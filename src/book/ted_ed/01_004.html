  <div class="content">
    <p>This chimpanzee stumbles across a windfall of overripe plums.</p>
    <p>Many of them have split open, drawing him to their intoxicating fruity odor.</p>
    <p>He gorges himself and begins to experience some… strange effects.</p>
    <p>This unwitting ape has stumbled on a process that humans will eventually harness to create beer, wine, and other
      alcoholic drinks.</p>
    <p>The sugars in overripe fruit attract microscopic organisms known as yeasts.</p>
    <p>As the yeasts feed on the fruit sugars they produce a compound called ethanol— the type of alcohol in alcoholic
      beverages.</p>
    <p>This process is called fermentation.</p>
    <p>Nobody knows exactly when humans began to create fermented beverages.</p>
    <p>The earliest known evidence comes from BCE in China, where residue in clay pots has revealed that people were
      making an alcoholic beverage from fermented rice, millet, grapes, and honey.</p>
    <p>Within a few thousand years, cultures all over the world were fermenting their own drinks.</p>
    <p>Ancient Mesopotamians and Egyptians made beer throughout the year from stored cereal grains.</p>
    <p>This beer was available to all social classes, and workers even received it in their daily rations.</p>
    <p>They also made wine, but because the climate wasn’t ideal for growing grapes, it was a rare and expensive
      delicacy.</p>
    <p>By contrast, in Greece and Rome, where grapes grew more easily, wine was as readily available as beer was in
      Egypt and Mesopotamia.</p>
    <p>Because yeasts will ferment basically any plant sugars, ancient peoples made alcohol from whatever crops and
      plants grew where they lived.</p>
    <p>In South America, people made chicha from grains, sometimes adding hallucinogenic herbs.</p>
    <p>In what’s now Mexico, pulque, made from cactus sap, was the drink of choice, while East Africans made banana and
      palm beer.</p>
    <p>And in the area that’s now Japan, people made sake from rice.</p>
    <p>Almost every region of the globe had its own fermented drinks.</p>
    <p>As alcohol consumption became part of everyday life, some authorities latched onto effects they perceived as
      positive—</p>
    <p>Greek physicians considered wine to be good for health, and poets testified to its creative qualities.</p>
    <p>Others were more concerned about alcohol’s potential for abuse.</p>
    <p>Greek philosophers promoted temperance.</p>
    <p>Early Jewish and Christian writers in Europe integrated wine into rituals but considered excessive intoxication a
      sin.</p>
    <p>And in the middle east, Africa, and Spain, an Islamic rule against praying while drunk gradually solidified into
      a general ban on alcohol.</p>
    <p>Ancient fermented beverages had relatively low alcohol content.</p>
    <p>At about % alcohol, the by-products wild yeasts generate during fermentation become toxic and kill them.</p>
    <p>When the yeasts die, fermentation stops and the alcohol content levels off.</p>
    <p>So for thousands of years, alcohol content was limited.</p>
    <p>That changed with the invention of a process called distillation. th century Arabic writings describe boiling
      fermented liquids to vaporize the alcohol in them.</p>
    <p>Alcohol boils at a lower temperature than water, so it vaporizes first.</p>
    <p>Capture this vapor, cool it down, and what’s left is liquid alcohol much more concentrated than any fermented
      beverage.</p>
    <p>At first, these stronger spirits were used for medicinal purposes.</p>
    <p>Then, spirits became an important trade commodity because, unlike beer and wine, they didn’t spoil.</p>
    <p>Rum made from sugar harvested in European colonies in the Caribbean became a staple for sailors and was traded to
      North America.</p>
    <p>Europeans brought brandy and gin to Africa and traded it for enslaved people, land, and goods like palm oil and
      rubber.</p>
    <p>Spirits became a form of money in these regions.</p>
    <p>During the Age of Exploration, spirits played a crucial role in long distance sea voyages.</p>
    <p>Sailing from Europe to east Asia and the Americas could take months, and keeping water fresh for the crews was a
      challenge.</p>
    <p>Adding a bucket of brandy to a water barrel kept water fresh longer because alcohol is a preservative that kills
      harmful microbes.</p>
    <p>So by the s, alcohol had gone from simply giving animals a buzz to fueling global trade and exploration— along
      with all their consequences.</p>
    <p>As time went on, its role in human society would only get more complicated.</p>
