    <p>When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this
      advice before:</p>
    <p>"Be more confident."</p>
    <p>And most likely, this is what you think when you hear it:</p>
    <p>"If only it were that simple."</p>
    <p>But what is confidence?</p>
    <p>Take the belief that you are valuable, worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism
      that comes when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously to face a
      challenge head-on.</p>
    <p>This is confidence.</p>
    <p>It turns thoughts into action.</p>
    <p>So where does confidence even come from?</p>
    <p>There are several factors that impact confidence.</p>
    <p>One: what you're born with, such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance of neurochemicals in
      your brain.</p>
    <p>Two: how you're treated.</p>
    <p>This includes the social pressures of your environment.</p>
    <p>And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about and
      respond to challenges and setbacks.</p>
    <p>It isn't possible to completely untangle these three factors, but the personal choices we make certainly play a
      major role in confidence development.</p>
    <p>So, by keeping in mind a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate our own confidence.</p>
    <p>Tip : a quick fix.</p>
    <p>There are a few tricks that can give you an immediate confidence boost in the short term.</p>
    <p>Picture your success when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music with deep
      bass; it can promote feelings of power.</p>
    <p>You can even strike a powerful pose or give yourself a pep talk.</p>
    <p>Tip two: believe in your ability to improve.</p>
    <p>If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think about your abilities and talents.</p>
    <p>Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed, like a muscle?</p>
    <p>These beliefs matter because they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks.</p>
    <p>If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents are locked in place, you might give up, assuming
      you've discovered something you're not very good at.</p>
    <p>But if you have a growth mindset and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity to learn and
      grow.</p>
    <p>Neuroscience supports the growth mindset.</p>
    <p>The connections in your brain do get stronger and grow with study and practice.</p>
    <p>It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset are more successful, getting better grades, and
      doing better in the face of challenges.</p>
    <p>Tip three: practice failure.</p>
    <p>Face it, you're going to fail sometimes.</p>
    <p>Everyone does.</p>
    <p>J.K. Rowling was rejected by twelve different publishers before one picked up "Harry Potter."</p>
    <p>The Wright Brothers built on history's failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a
      successful airplane.</p>
    <p>Studies show that those who fail regularly and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond to challenges
      and setbacks in a constructive way.</p>
    <p>They learn how to try different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere.</p>
    <p>So, think of a challenge you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make
      mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do.</p>
    <p>Give yourself a pep talk, stand up, and go for it.</p>
    <p>The excitement you'll feel knowing that whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge and
      understanding.</p>
    <p>This is confidence.</p>
