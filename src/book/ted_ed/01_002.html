    <p> a sea of decisions stretches before us.</p>
    <p>but others have a larger impact on our lives.</p>
    <p> which politicianshould I vote for?Should I try the latest diet craze?Or will email make me a millionaire?We're
      bombarded with so many decisionsthat it's impossible to make a perfect choice every time.</p>
    <p>But there are many ways to improve our chances,and one particularly effective techniqueis critical thinking.</p>
    <p>This is a way of approaching a questionthat allows us to carefully deconstruct a situation,such as bias and
      manipulation,and make the best decision.</p>
    <p>If the critical part sounds negativethat's because in a way it is.</p>
    <p>Rather than choosing an answer because it feels right,a person who uses critical thinkingsubjects all available
      options to scrutinyand skepticism.</p>
    <p>they'll eliminate everything but the mostuseful and reliable information.</p>
    <p>There are many different waysof approaching critical thinking,but here's one five-step processthat may help you
      solve any number of problems.</p>
    <p>One: formulate your question.</p>
    <p> know what you're looking for.</p>
    <p>This isn't always as straightforward as it sounds.</p>
    <p> if you're decidingwhether to try out the newest diet craze,your reasons for doing so may be obscuredby other
      factors,like claims that you'll see resultsin just two weeks.</p>
    <p>But if you approach the situationwith a clear view of what you're actually trying to accomplish by
      dieting,that'll equip you to sift through this information critically,and decide whether the new fadreally suits
      your needs.</p>
    <p>Two: gather your information.</p>
    <p>so having a clear idea of your questionwill help you determine what's relevant.</p>
    <p>If you're trying to decide on a dietto improve your nutrition,or seek other people's testimonies.</p>
    <p>Information gathering helps youweigh different options,moving you closer to a decisionthat meets your goal.</p>
    <p>something you do by asking critical questions.</p>
    <p>"What concepts are at work?""What assumptions exist?""Is my interpretation of the informationlogically sound?" in
      an email that promisesyou millions, "What is shapingmy approach to this situation?""Do I assume the sender is
      telling the truth?" is it logical to assume I'll win any money?"Four: consider the implications.</p>
    <p>and you've selected a politicalcandidate based on their promiseto make it cheaper for driversto fill up on
      gas.</p>
    <p> that seems great.</p>
    <p>But what about the long-term environmental effects?If gasoline use is less restricted by cost,this could also
      cause a hugesurge in air pollution,an unintended consequence that's important to think about.</p>
    <p>Five: explore other points of view.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself why so many people are drawnto the policies of the opposing political candidate.</p>
    <p>Even if you disagree with everything that candidate says,exploring the full spectrum of viewpointsmight explain
      why some policies that don'tseem valid to you appeal to others.</p>
    <p>This will allow you to explore alternatives,and ultimately help you make moreinformed decisions.</p>
    <p>and it certainly won't eradicate difficultdecisions from our lives.</p>
    <p>But it can help us increase the number of positive choices we make.</p>
    <p>Critical thinking can give us the toolsto sift through a sea of informationand find what we're looking for.</p>
    <p>it has the power to make the worlda more reasonable place.</p>
