      Scene: Lobby of the apartment building, Howard, Raj, Sheldon and Leonard enter in combat gear, covered in blue
      paint.</p>
    <p>
      Raj: Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's Bar-Mitzvah party.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the
      chain of command.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Sheldon, let it go.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”</p>
    <p>
      Penny: (Arriving) Oh, hey guys.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Hello Penny.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: Morning ma’am.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar,
      there will be an enquiry.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: A party?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Yeah.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: A boy-girl party?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my
      friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing...</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Dancing?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Yeah, I don't know, Penny...</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: The thing is, we’re not....</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: We’re really more....</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: No.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: A Halloween party?</p>
    <p>
      Howard: As in, costumes?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Well, yeah.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Is there a theme?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Um, yeah, Halloween.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: As usual, I'm not following.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy...</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Sure.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: What about comic-books?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Fine.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Anime?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Of course.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: TV, film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods...</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.</p>
    <p>
      Scene: The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: (Off) I'll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash costume. Opens door.)</p>
    <p>
      Howard: (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume) Bjow (They stare at each other in shock.)</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Oh, no.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)</p>
    <p>
      Raj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no!</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.</p>
    <p>
      Raj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: No, no, no, it's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?</p>
    <p>
      All: Agreed.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: I call Frodo!</p>
    <p>
      All: Damn!</p>
    <p>
      Scene: The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the
      door.</p>
    <p>
      Raj: (Entering dressed as Thor) Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: You went with Thor?</p>
    <p>
      Raj: What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism.
      I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon (entering in a body suit
      featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.</p>
    <p>
      Raj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than
      you, but it's basically the same look, man.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: No, it's not...</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I
      need you not to embarrass me tonight.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great
      anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer
      group. A potential close friend and... perhaps more. I don't want to look like a dork.</p>
    <p>
      Scene: The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny's door with his bow.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: (Opening door, not in costume) Oh, hey guys.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Hey, sorry we’re late.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Late? It's 7</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: And you said the party starts at seven.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: It's 7</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: What, are all the girls in the bathroom?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Probably, but in their own homes.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: So what time does the costume parade start?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: The parade?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic,
      most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: This party is just going to suck.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan,
      that's so cute.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Actually, Penny, he's Rob...</p>
    <p>
      Howard: I'm Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of
      the wave and the observer.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves
      comfortable.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Okay.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: See, people get it.</p>
    <p>
      Raj: Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: We’re socialising. Meeting new people.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Telepathically?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: (Crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen) Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!</p>
    <p>
      Raj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.</p>
    <p>
      Raj: What is your move?</p>
    <p>
      Howard: I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I
      shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we’re in sync, we belong together.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Where do you get this stuff?</p>
    <p>
      Howard: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up
      girls.</p>
    <p>
      Raj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times,
      even effeminate men.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.</p>
    <p>
      Nurse Costume Girl: No thanks.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: I want to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: How so?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured,
      but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Go on.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which
      is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Then what happens?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: That's as far as I’ve gotten.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Good luck.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: No, you're coming with me.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Come on.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Aren’t you afraid I'll embarrass you?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA,
      analyzing wreckage.</p>
    <p>
      Girl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi!</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Hi.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Hello.</p>
    <p>
      Girl: So, what are you supposed to be?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!</p>
    <p>
      Girl: Uh, a choo-choo train?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!</p>
    <p>
      Girl: A brain damaged choo-choo train?</p>
    <p>
      Girl in Butterfly Costume: (Dropping onto sofa next to Raj) How wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.)</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww!</p>
    <p>
      Girl: I still don't get it.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: I'm the Doppler Effect.</p>
    <p>
      Girl: Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Oh no.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: What?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. (Penny
      and Kurt hug).</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Maybe they just want to be friends.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Then he and I are on equal ground.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his
      choice of female partners.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his
      fancy.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the
      alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education
      system.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: What, you're a zebra, right?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Yet another child left behind.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: No, I'm a Hobbit.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: What's the difference?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall
      warrior.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: Well, whatever, why don't you go hop off on a quest, I'm talking to Penny here.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: I think we’re all talking to Penny here.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: I'm not. No offence.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Alright Kurt, be nice.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Kurt!</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on
      an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: Are you calling me a puffy animal?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the
      evolutionary tree.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: If he understands that, you're in trouble.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: So what, I'm unevolved?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: You're in trouble.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Okay, Kurt, please.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons
      in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: A homo-habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: What?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: I think I’ve made my point.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than
      useless.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: (Physically lifting Leonard from the ground) C – O – N... frontation!</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Kurt, put him down this instant.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: He started it.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down.</p>
    <p>
      Kurt: Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: He's a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Leonard, are you okay.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late
      so....</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it's any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in
      his place.</p>
    <p>
      Scene: The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: What's that?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want
      to talk about it?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: No.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Good. There there was really all I had.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Good night Sheldon.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Good night Leonard.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: (Knocking on door and entering) Hey Leonard.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Hi Penny.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: I'm fine.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: I'm so sorry about what happened.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: It's not your fault.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: So why was he at your party?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was... just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just
      going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and... I can't go
      back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and
      I just want to... (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard’s shoulder.)</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: There there.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: God, what is wrong with me.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Nothing, you're perfect.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Gah, I'm not perfect.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Yes you are.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: You really think so, don't you? (She kisses hm.)</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Penny?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Yeah.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: How much have you had to drink tonight?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Just.... a lot.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Are you sure that you're being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with
      what's going on here?</p>
    <p>
      Penny: It might. Boy, you're really smart.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Yeah, I'm a frickin’ genius.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: I should probably go.</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: Probably.</p>
    <p>
      Penny: (In doorway) Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.)</p>
    <p>
      Leonard: That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and
      chains it.)</p>
    <p>
      Scene: The apartment, there is a knock on the door.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)</p>
    <p>
      Howard: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Thank you for the clarification.</p>
    <p>
      Howard: I'm supposed to give him a ride home.</p>
    <p>
      Sheldon: Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer.</p>
    <p>
      Scene: A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj.</p>
    <p>
      Butterfly Girl: Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You're gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such
      a good listener!
