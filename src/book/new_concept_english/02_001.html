        <p>
            Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it.
            A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could
            not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any
            attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.</p>
        <p>
            'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely. 'This is a private conversation!'
