            It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got
            up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining
            again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm
            coming to see you.'</p>
        <p>
            'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.</p>
        <p>
            'What are you doing?' she asked.</p>
        <p>
            'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated.</p>
        <p>
            'Dear me,' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'
