    <div class="content">
        <p>HANS: Where do you come from?</p>
        <p>
            JIM: I come from England.</p>
        <p>
            HANS: What's the climate like in your country?</p>
        <p>
            JIM: It's mild, but it's not always pleasant.</p>
        <p>
            JIM: The weather's often cold in North and windy in the East.<br/>
            It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the south.</p>
        <p>
            HANS: Which seasons do you like best?</p>
        <p>
            JIM: I like spring and summer.<br/>
            The days are long and the night are short.<br/>
            The sun rises early and sets late.</p>
        <p>
            JIM: I don't like autumn and winter.<br/>
            The days are short and the nights are long.<br/>
            The sun rises late and set early.<br/>
            Our climate is not very good, but it's certainly interesting.<br/>
            It's our favourite subject of conversation.</p>
