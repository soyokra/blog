Today we have something a little different.
</p><p>
Dr. Jane Goodall is going to tell you a story.
</p><p>
Ready?
</p><p>
Let's begin.
</p><p>
It starts as a whisper, a word on the air.
</p><p>
It can't quite be heard, but you know that it's there.
</p><p>
As gentle as sunlight, as tenacious as hale, in its route to the heart, it could not but prevail.
</p><p>
And the people looked up from their day-to-day tasks, their day-to-day jobs and their day-to-day masks.
</p><p>
They heard or they felt where the whisper could lead, and they looked with eyes wide at what that might mean.
</p><p>
And once they could see it, they hadn't a chance
</p><p>
To resist the sweet song of the deep spell it cast.
</p><p>
But the feeling it brought them at first glance was pain, as they lifted their eyes on the land they had claimed.
</p><p>
Since they saw at last as if raised from a dream, they were almost alone on the land and the sea.
</p><p>
For the trees had almost gone, and the bees had almost gone, and the creatures in their shells by the seas had almost gone.
</p><p>
And the people felt sad as they saw their new Earth, but they knew this was it, one wild chance for rebirth.
</p><p>
Breaking new ground, seeds rolling down, smell of the earth on your hands and your brow.
</p><p>
No time for sorrow, we're building tomorrow.
</p><p>
The sound of things growing now keeps us around.
</p><p>
As the wildness grows, and the deep wood grows,and the sense that the future's come to meet you grows, There's no chance we can rest.
</p><p>
We must do our best.
</p><p>
This moment can lead us back home, that's our test.
</p><p>
It starts as a whisper, a word on the air.
</p><p>
It can't quite be heard, but you know that it's there.
</p><p>
It then spoke like thunder.
</p><p>
Until we all moved.
</p><p>
And we could.
</p><p>
And we did.
</p><p>
And it's done.
</p><p>
She's renewed.
