      Christianity was firmly established in north-western Europe in
      the twelfth century, but there was still interest in the heathen
      legends of the gods. By then men were secure enough in their
      faith not to fear a resurgence of the ancient paganism, and felt
      new stirrings of affection for the old tales, never forgotten by
      the northern poets. The complex, sophisticated verses of the
      skaldic poets were very fashionable at the courts of kings and
      in the halls of cultured men, and these poets relied on the myths
      as their main source of imagery. Their poetry was filled with
      allusions to the old stories, some of them mere cliches, some
      neat and witty, and some retaining real poetic fire. In seventeenth-century England the poet Milton enriched his picture of
      a Biblical Eden by reference to such legends as the descent of
      Proserpine to Hades, and he could expect an instant response
      from readers trained in classical lore. In the same way a medieval Icelandic poet could refer to poetry as the ship of the dwarfs,
      to gold as the tears of Freyja or the cushion of the dragon
      Fafnir, and to a sword as the fire of the Valkyries: his audience
      would comprehend his meaning from their knowledge of the
      myths. He could do this whether he were praising a loved
      woman, describing adventures in battle, or expressing his enthusiasm for the cause of Christ, and be confident that his
      hearers would seize on the imaginative implications of his
      images.

      By the twelfth century it was growing more difficult to do
      this. The old myths were fading from men's minds: the churchmen sometimes condemned them as evil, and cultured young
      men were reared in the new Christian learning instead of the
      heathen traditions. It therefore occurred to a gifted Icelandic
      scholar, Snorri Sturluson, that it would be worth while to write
      a book about these matters before they were utterly lost. Snorri
      was a man of extraordinary gifts: chieftain, politician, historian,
      saga-writer, and poet. He planned his work as a handbook for
      poets and intellectuals, a guide to poetic imagery. Since he was
      a brilliant stylist, writing in his native Icelandic; it was no dry
      antiquarian treatise; he told the old tales of the gods with wit,
      irony, and a lively delight in their imaginative beauty. He called
      his book the Edda, and it is known as the Prose Edda to distinguish it from a collection of poems with the same name. It
      is from this book of Snorri's, written about 1220, that our main
      impression of northern mythology has been derived.

      There is little doubt that on the whole Snorri has given us
      a faithful picture of heathen mythology as he found it in the
      poets. Sometimes he quotes from poems which we still possess,
      and we can see what he is about; sometimes he gives us stanzas
      from lost poems, or tells stories which seem to be summaries
      of narrative poems now vanished; sometimes it is obvious
      that he is quoting statements which he himself does not understand. He was a fine scholar and literary artist, and was able
      on the whole to resist the temptation to alter his sources so as
      to rationalize them or to point a Christian moral. But he was
      primarily a literary artist, not an anthropologist or religious
      historian, and he was writing in the thirteenth century, not the
      heathen period. Much of his material came from poets who
      themselves had written in a Christian age. The question has to
      be raised then how far in his book we are dealing with an artificial world of myth, far removed from the living faith of the
      heathen period. For the moment however, provided we remember his limitations, there seems no better introduction to
      the mythology of the north than that which Snorri gives us.
