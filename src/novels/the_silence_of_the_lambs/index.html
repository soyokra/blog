    <p>Behavioral Science, the FBI section that deals with serial murder, is on the bottom  floor of the Academy building at Quantico, half-buried in the earth. Clarice Starling  reached it flushed after a fast walk from Hogan's Alley on the firing range. She had grass  in her hair and grass stains on her FBI Academy windbreaker from diving to the ground  under fire in an arrest problem on the range.   </p><p>No one was in the outer office, so she fluffed briefly by her reflection in the glass  doors. She knew she could look all right without primping. Her hands smelled of  gunsmoke, but there was no time to wash--- Section Chief Crawford's summons had said  now.   </p><p>She found Jack Crawford alone in the cluttered suite of offices. He was standing  at someone else's desk talking on the telephone and she had a chance to look him over for  the first time in a year. What she saw disturbed her.   </p><p>Normally, Crawford looked like a fit, middle-aged engineer who might have paid  his way through college playing baseball--- a crafty catcher, tough when he blocked the  plate. Now he was thin, his shirt collar was too big, and he had dark puffs under his  reddened eyes. Everyone who could read the papers knew Behavioral Science section  was catching hell. Starling hoped Crawford wasn't on the juice. That seemed most  unlikely here.   </p><p>Crawford ended his telephone conversation with a sharp "No." He took her file  from under his arm and opened it.   </p><p>"Starling, Clarice M., good morning," he said.   </p><p>"Hello." Her smile was only polite.   </p><p>"Nothing's wrong. I hope the call didn't spook you."   </p><p>"No." Not totally true, Starling thought.   </p><p>"Your instructors tell me you're doing well, top quarter of the class."   </p><p>"I hope so, they haven't posted anything."   </p><p>"I ask them from time to time."   </p><p>That surprised Starling; she had written Crawford off as a two-faced recruiting  sergeant son of a bitch.   </p><p>She had met Special Agent Crawford when he was a guest lecturer at the  University of Virginia. The quality of his criminology seminars was a factor in her  coming to the Bureau. She wrote him a note when she qualified for the Academy, but he  never replied, and for the three months she had been a trainee at Quantico, he had ignored  her.   </p><p>Starling came from people who do not ask for favors or press for friendship, but  she was puzzled and regretful at Crawford's behavior. Now, in his presence, she liked  him again, she was sorry to note.   </p><p>Clearly something was wrong with him. There was a peculiar cleverness in  Crawford, aside from his intelligence, and Starling had first noticed it in his color sense  and the textures of his clothing, even within the FBI-clone standards of agent dress. Now  he was neat but drab, as though he were molting.   </p><p>"A job came up and I thought about you," he said. "It's not really a job, it's more  of an interesting errand. Push Berry's stuff off that chair and sit down. You put down here  that you want to come directly to Behavioral Science when you get through with the  Academy."   </p><p>"I do."   </p><p>"You have a lot of forensics, but no law enforcement background. We look for six  years, minimum."   </p><p>"My father was a marshal, I know the life."   </p><p>Crawford smiled a little. "What you do have is a double major in psychology and  criminology, and how many summers working in a mental health center--- two?"   </p><p>"Two."   </p><p>"Your counselor's license, is it current?"   </p><p>"It's good for two more years. I got it before you had the seminar at UVA---  before I decided to do this."   </p><p>"You got stuck in the hiring freeze."   </p><p>Starling nodded. "I was lucky though--- I found out in time to qualify as a  Forensic Fellow. Then I could work in the lab until the Academy had an opening."   </p><p>"You wrote to me about coming here, didn't you, and I don't think I answered--- I  know I didn't. I should have."   </p><p>"You've had plenty else to do."   </p><p>"Do you know about VI-CAP?"   </p><p>"I know it's the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program. The Law Enforcement  Bulletin says you're working on a database, but you aren't operational yet."   </p><p>Crawford nodded. "We've developed a questionnaire. It applies to all the known  serial murderers in modern times." He handed her a thick sheaf of papers in a flimsy  binding. "There's a section for investigators, and one for surviving victims, if any. The  blue is for the killer to answer if he will, and the pink is a series of questions an examiner  asks the killer, getting his reactions as well as his answers. It's a lot of paperwork."   </p><p>Paperwork. Clarice Starling's self-interest snuffled ahead like a keen beagle. She  smelled a job offer coming--- probably the drudgery of feeding raw data into a new  computer system. It was tempting to get into Behavioral Science in any capacity she  could, but she knew what happens to a woman if she's ever pegged as a secretary--- it  sticks until the end of time. A choice was coming, and she wanted to choose well.   </p><p>Crawford was waiting for something--- he must have asked her a question.  Starling had to scramble to recall it.   </p><p>"What tests have you given? Minnesota Multiphasic, ever? Rorschach?"   </p><p>"Yes, MMPI, never Rorschach," she said. "I've done Thematic Apperception and  I've given children Bender-Gestalt."   </p><p>"Do you spook easily, Starling?"   </p><p>"Not yet."   </p><p>"See, we've tried to interview and examine all the thirty-two known serial  murderers we have in custody, to build up a database for psychological profiling is  unsolved cases. Most of them went along with it--- I think they're driven to show off, a  lot of them. Twenty-seven were willing to cooperate. Four on death row with appeals  pending clammed up, understandably. But the one we want the most, we haven't been  able to get. I want you to go after him tomorrow in the asylum."   </p><p>Clarice Starling felt a glad knocking in her chest and some apprehension too.   </p><p>"Who's the subject?"   </p><p>"The psychiatrist--- Dr. Hannibal Lecter," Crawford said.   </p><p>A brief silence follows the name, always, in any civilized gathering.   </p><p>Starling looked at Crawford steadily, but she was too still. "Hannibal the  Cannibal," she said.   </p><p>"Yes."   </p><p>"Yes, well--- Okay, right. I'm glad of the chance, but you have to know I'm  wondering--- why me?"   </p><p>"Mainly because you're available," Crawford said. "I don't expect him to  cooperate. He's already refused, but it was through an intermediary--- the director of the  hospital. I have to be able to say our qualified examiner went to him and asked him  personally. There are reasons that don't concern you. I don't have anybody left in this  section to do it."   </p><p>' "You're jammed--- Buffalo Bill--- and the things in Nevada," Starling said.   </p><p>"You got it. It's the old story--- not enough warm bodies."   </p><p>"You said tomorrow--- you're in a hurry. Any bearing on a current case?"   </p><p>"No. I wish there were."   </p><p>"If he balks on me, do you still want a psychological evaluation?"   </p><p>"No. I'm waist-deep in inaccessible-patient evaluations of Dr. Lecter and they're  all different."   </p><p>Crawford shook two vitamin C tablets into his palm, and mixed an Alka-Seltzer at  the water cooler to wash them down. "It's ridiculous, you know; Lecter's a psychiatrist  and he writes for the psychiatric journals himself--- extraordinary stuff--- but it's never  about his own little anomalies. He pretended to go along with the hospital director,  Chilton, once in some tests--- sitting around with a blood-pressure cuff on his penis,  looking at wreck pictures--- then Lecter published first what he'd learned about Chilton  and made a fool out of him. He responds to serious correspondence from psychiatric  students in fields unrelated to his case, and that's all he does. If he won't talk to you, I just  want straight reporting. How does he look, how does his cell look, what's he doing. Local  color, so to speak. Watch out for the press going in and coming out. Not the real press,  the supermarket press. They love Lecter even better than Prince Andrew."   </p><p>"Didn't a sleazo magazine offer him fifty thousand dollars for some recipes? I  seem to remember that," Starling said.   </p><p>Crawford nodded. "I'm pretty sure the National Tattler has bought somebody  inside the hospital and they may know you're coming after I make the appointment."   </p><p>Crawford leaned forward until he faced her at a distance of two feet. She watched  his half-glasses blur the bags under his eyes. He had gargled recently with Listerine.   </p><p>"Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?"   </p><p>"Yes sir."   </p><p>"Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton, the head of the mental  hospital, will go over the physical procedure you use to deal with him. Don't deviate from  it. Do not deviate from it one iota for any reason. If Lecter talks to you at all, he'll just be  trying to find out about you. It's the kind of curiosity that makes a snake look in a bird's  nest. We both know you have to back-and-forth a little in interviews, but you tell him no  specifics about yourself. You don't want any of your personal facts in his head. You  know what he did to Will Graham."   </p><p>"I read about it when it happened."   </p><p>"He gutted Will with a linoleum knife when Will caught up with him. It's a  wonder Will didn't die. Remember the Red Dragon? Lecter turned Francis Dolarhyde  onto Will and his family. Will's face looks like damn Picasso drew him, thanks to Lecter.  He tore a nurse up in the asylum. Do your job, just don't ever forget what he is."   </p><p>"And what's that? Do you know?"   </p><p>"I know he's a monster. Beyond that, nobody can say for sure. Maybe you'll find  out; I didn't pick you out of a hat, Starling. You asked me a couple of interesting  questions when I was at UVA. The Director will see your own report over your signature- -- if it's clear and tight and organized. I decide that. And I will have it by 0900 Sunday.  Okay, Starling, carry on in the prescribed manner."   </p><p>Crawford smiled at her, but his eyes were dead. </p>
