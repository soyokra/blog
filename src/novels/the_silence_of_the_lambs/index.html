      <div><p><b>CHAPTER 1 <br/> <br/>B</b>ehavioral Science, the FBI section that deals with serial murder, is on the
        bottom <br/></p>
        <p>floor of the Academy building at Quantico, half-buried in the earth. Clarice Starling <br/>reached it flushed
          after a fast walk from Hogan's Alley on the firing range. She had grass <br/>in her hair and grass stains on
          her FBI Academy windbreaker from diving to the ground <br/>under fire in an arrest problem on the range. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>No one was in the outer office, so she fluffed briefly by her reflection in the glass <br/>doors. She knew
          she could look all right without primping. Her hands smelled of <br/>gunsmoke, but there was no time to
          wash--- Section Chief Crawford's summons had said <br/>now. <br/></p>
        <p>She found Jack Crawford alone in the cluttered suite of offices. He was standing <br/>at someone else's desk
          talking on the telephone and she had a chance to look him over for <br/>the first time in a year. What she saw
          disturbed her. <br/></p>
        <p>Normally, Crawford looked like a fit, middle-aged engineer who might have paid <br/>his way through college
          playing baseball--- a crafty catcher, tough when he blocked the <br/>plate. Now he was thin, his shirt collar
          was too big, and he had dark puffs under his <br/>reddened eyes. Everyone who could read the papers knew
          Behavioral Science section <br/>was catching hell. Starling hoped Crawford wasn't on the juice. That seemed
          most <br/>unlikely here. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford ended his telephone conversation with a sharp &quot;No.&quot; He took her file <br/>from under his
          arm and opened it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Starling, Clarice M., good morning,&quot; he said. <br/>&quot;Hello.&quot; Her smile was only polite.
          <br/>&quot;Nothing's wrong. I hope the call didn't spook you.&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <i>Not totally
            true, </i>Starling thought. <br/>&quot;Your instructors tell me you're doing well, top quarter of the class.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I hope so, they haven't posted anything.&quot; <br/>&quot;I ask them from time to time.&quot; <br/>That
          surprised Starling; she had written Crawford off as a two-faced recruiting <br/></p>
        <p>sergeant son of a bitch. <br/>She had met Special Agent Crawford when he was a guest lecturer at the <br/>
        </p>
        <p>University of Virginia. The quality of his criminology seminars was a factor in her <br/>coming to the
          Bureau. She wrote him a note when she qualified for the Academy, but he <br/>never replied, and for the three
          months she had been a trainee at Quantico, he had ignored <br/>her. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling came from people who do not ask for favors or press for friendship, but <br/>she was puzzled and
          regretful at Crawford's behavior. Now, in his presence, she liked <br/>him again, she was sorry to note. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Clearly something was wrong with him. There was a peculiar cleverness in <br/>Crawford, aside from his
          intelligence, and Starling had first noticed it in his color sense <br/>and the textures of his clothing, even
          within the FBI-clone standards of agent dress. Now <br/>he was neat but drab, as though he were molting. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;A job came up and I thought about you,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not really a job, it's more <br/>of an
          interesting errand. Push Berry's stuff off that chair and sit down. You put down here <br/>that you want to
          come directly to Behavioral Science when you get through with the </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Academy.&quot; <br/>&quot;I do.&quot; <br/>&quot;You have a lot of forensics, but no law enforcement
        background. We look for six <br/></p>
        <p>years, minimum.&quot; <br/>&quot;My father was a marshal, I know the life.&quot; <br/>Crawford smiled a
          little. &quot;What you <i>do </i>have is a double major in psychology and <br/></p>
        <p>criminology, and how many summers working in a mental health center--- two?&quot; <br/>&quot;Two.&quot; <br/>&quot;Your
          counselor's license, is it current?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's good for two more years. I got it before you had the
          seminar at UVA--- <br/></p>
        <p>before I decided to do this.&quot; <br/>&quot;You got stuck in the hiring freeze.&quot; <br/>Starling nodded.
          &quot;I was lucky though--- I found out in time to qualify as a <br/></p>
        <p>Forensic Fellow. Then I could work in the lab until the Academy had an opening.&quot; <br/>&quot;You wrote to
          me about coming here, didn't you, and I don't think I answered--- I <br/></p>
        <p>know I didn't. I should have.&quot; <br/>&quot;You've had plenty else to do.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you know
          about VI-CAP?&quot; <br/>&quot;I know it's the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program. The <i>Law Enforcement
            <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>Bulletin </i>says you're working on a database, but you aren't operational yet.&quot; <br/>Crawford
          nodded. &quot;We've developed a questionnaire. It applies to all the known <br/></p>
        <p>serial murderers in modern times.&quot; He handed her a thick sheaf of papers in a flimsy <br/>binding.
          &quot;There's a section for investigators, and one for surviving victims, if any. The <br/>blue is for the
          killer to answer if he will, and the pink is a series of questions an examiner <br/>asks the killer, getting
          his reactions as well as his answers. It's a lot of paperwork.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Paperwork. Clarice Starling's self-interest snuffled ahead like a keen beagle. She <br/>smelled a job offer
          coming--- probably the drudgery of feeding raw data into a new <br/>computer system. It was tempting to get
          into Behavioral Science in any capacity she <br/>could, but she knew what happens to a woman if she's ever
          pegged as a secretary--- it <br/>sticks until the end of time. A choice was coming, and she wanted to choose
          well. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was waiting for something--- he must have asked her a question. <br/>Starling had to scramble to
          recall it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What tests have you given? Minnesota Multiphasic, ever? Rorschach?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, MMPI, never
          Rorschach,&quot; she said. &quot;I've done Thematic Apperception and <br/></p>
        <p>I've given children Bender-Gestalt.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you spook easily, Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Not yet.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;See, we've tried to interview and examine all the thirty-two known serial <br/></p>
        <p>murderers we have in custody, to build up a database for psychological profiling is <br/>unsolved cases. Most
          of them went along with it--- I think they're driven to show off, a <br/>lot of them. Twenty-seven were
          willing to cooperate. Four on death row with appeals <br/>pending clammed up, understandably. But the one we
          want the most, we haven't been <br/>able to get. I want you to go after him tomorrow in the asylum.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice Starling felt a glad knocking in her chest and some apprehension too. <br/>&quot;Who's the subject?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;The psychiatrist--- Dr. Hannibal Lecter,&quot; Crawford said. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>A brief silence follows the name, always, in any civilized gathering. <br/>Starling looked at Crawford
        steadily, but she was too still. &quot;Hannibal the <br/></p>
        <p>Cannibal,&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, well--- Okay, right. I'm glad of the chance,
          but you have to know I'm <br/></p>
        <p>wondering--- why me?&quot; <br/>&quot;Mainly because you're available,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;I don't
          expect him to <br/></p>
        <p>cooperate. He's already refused, but it was through an intermediary--- the director of the <br/>hospital. I
          have to be able to say our qualified examiner went to him and asked him <br/>personally. There are reasons
          that don't concern you. I don't have anybody left in this <br/>section to do it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>' &quot;You're jammed--- Buffalo Bill--- and the things in Nevada,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;You got
          it. It's the old story--- not enough warm bodies.&quot; <br/>&quot;You said tomorrow--- you're in a hurry. Any
          bearing on a current case?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. I wish there were.&quot; <br/>&quot;If he balks on me, do you
          still want a psychological evaluation?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. I'm waist-deep in inaccessible-patient evaluations
          of Dr. Lecter and they're <br/></p>
        <p>all different.&quot; <br/>Crawford shook two vitamin C tablets into his palm, and mixed an Alka-Seltzer at
          <br/></p>
        <p>the water cooler to wash them down. &quot;It's ridiculous, you know; Lecter's a psychiatrist <br/>and he
          writes for the psychiatric journals himself--- extraordinary stuff--- but it's never <br/>about his own little
          anomalies. He pretended to go along with the hospital director, <br/>Chilton, once in some tests--- sitting
          around with a blood-pressure cuff on his penis, <br/>looking at wreck pictures--- then Lecter published first
          what he'd learned about Chilton <br/>and made a fool out of him. He responds to serious correspondence from
          psychiatric <br/>students in fields unrelated to his case, and that's all he does. If he won't talk to you, I
          just <br/>want straight reporting. How does he look, how does his cell look, what's he doing. Local <br/>color,
          so to speak. Watch out for the press going in and coming out. Not the real press, <br/>the supermarket press.
          They love Lecter even better than Prince Andrew.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Didn't a sleazo magazine offer him fifty thousand dollars for some recipes? I <br/>seem to remember
          that,&quot; Starling said. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford nodded. &quot;I'm pretty sure the <i>National Tattler </i>has bought somebody <br/>inside the
          hospital and they may know you're coming after I make the appointment.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford leaned forward until he faced her at a distance of two feet. She watched <br/>his half-glasses blur
          the bags under his eyes. He had gargled recently with Listerine. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton, the head of the mental <br/></p>
        <p>hospital, will go over the physical procedure you use to deal with him. Don't deviate from <br/>it. <i>Do not
          deviate from it one iota for any reason. </i>If Lecter talks to you at all, he'll just be <br/>trying to find
          out about you. It's the kind of curiosity that makes a snake look in a bird's <br/>nest. We both know you have
          to back-and-forth a little in interviews, but you tell him no <br/>specifics about yourself. You don't want
          any of your personal facts in his head. You <br/>know what he did to Will Graham.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I read about it when it happened.&quot; <br/>&quot;He gutted Will with a linoleum knife when Will
          caught up with him. It's a </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>wonder Will didn't die. Remember the Red Dragon? Lecter turned Francis Dolarhyde <br/>onto Will and his
        family. Will's face looks like damn Picasso drew him, thanks to Lecter. <br/>He tore a nurse up in the asylum.
        Do your job, just don't ever forget what he is.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;And what's that? Do you know?&quot; <br/>&quot;I know he's a monster. Beyond that, nobody can say for
          sure. Maybe you'll find <br/></p>
        <p>out; I didn't pick you out of a hat, Starling. You asked me a couple of interesting <br/>questions when I was
          at UVA. The Director will see your own report over your signature-<br/>-- if it's clear and tight and
          organized. I decide that. And I <i>will </i>have it by 0900 Sunday. <br/>Okay, Starling, carry on in the
          prescribed manner.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford smiled at her, but his eyes were dead. <br/> <br/></p>
        <p><b> <br/>CHAPTER 2 <br/> <br/>D</b>r. Frederick Chilton, fifty-eight, administrator of the Baltimore State
          Hospital <br/></p>
        <p>for the Criminally Insane, has a long, wide desk upon which there are no hard or sharp <br/>objects. Some of
          the staff call it &quot;the moat.&quot; Other staff members don't know what the <br/>word <i>moat </i>means.
          Dr. Chilton remained seated behind his desk when Clarice Starling <br/>came into his office. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;We've had a lot of detectives here, but I can't remember one so attractive,&quot; <br/>Chilton 'said
          without getting up. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling knew without thinking about it that the shine on his extended hand was <br/>lanolin from patting his
          hair. She let go before he did. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;It is <i>Miss </i>Sterling, isn't it?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's <i>Star</i>ling, Doctor, with an <i>a</i>.
          Thank you for your time.&quot; <br/>&quot;So the FBI is going to the girls like everything else, ha, ha.&quot;
          He added the <br/></p>
        <p>tobacco smile he uses to separate his sentences. <br/>&quot;The Bureau's improving, Dr. Chilton. It certainly
          is.&quot; <br/>&quot;Will you be in Baltimore for several days? You know, you can have just as good <br/></p>
        <p>a time here as you can in Washington or New York, if you know the town.&quot; <br/>She looked away to spare
          herself his smile and knew at once that he had <br/></p>
        <p>registered her distaste. &quot;I'm sure it's a great town, but my instructions are to see Dr. <br/>Lecter and
          report back this afternoon.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Is there someplace I could call you in Washington for a follow-up, later on?&quot; <br/>&quot;Of
          course. It's kind of you to think of it. Special Agent Jack Crawford's in charge <br/></p>
        <p>of this project, and you can always reach me through him.&quot; <br/>&quot;I see,&quot; Chilton said. His
          cheeks, mottled with pink, clashed with the improbable <br/></p>
        <p>red-brown of his coif. ''Give me your identification, please.&quot; He let her remain standing <br/>through
          his leisurely examination of her ID card. Then he handed it back and rose. &quot;This <br/>won't take much
          time. Come along.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I understood you'd brief me, Dr. Chilton,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;I can do that while we walk.&quot;
          He came around his desk, looking at his watch. &quot;I <br/></p>
        <p>have a lunch in half an hour.&quot; <br/><i>Dammit, she should have read him better, quicker. He might not be
          a total jerk. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>He might know something useful. It wouldn't have hurt her to simper once, even if she <br/>wasn't at it.

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;Dr. Chilton, I have an appointment with you now. It was set at your convenience, <br/>when you could
        give me some time. Things could come up during the interview--- I may <br/>need to go over some of his responses
        with you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I really, really doubt it. Oh, I need to make a telephone call before we go. I'll <br/>catch up with
          you in the outer office.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'd like to leave my coat and umbrella here.&quot; <br/>&quot;Out there,&quot; Chilton said. &quot;Give
          them to Alan in the outer office. He'll put them <br/></p>
        <p>away.&quot; <br/>Alan wore the pajamalike garment issued to the inmates. He was wiping out <br/></p>
        <p>ashtrays with the tail of his shirt. <br/>He rolled his tongue around in his cheek as he took Starling's
          coat. <br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;You're more than welcome. How often do you shit?&quot;
          Alan asked. <br/>&quot;What did you say?&quot; <br/>&quot;Does it come out lo-o-o-o-nnng?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll
          hang these somewhere myself.&quot; <br/>&quot;You don't have anything in the way--- you can bend over and
          watch it come out <br/></p>
        <p>and see if it changes color when the air hits it, do you do that? Does it look like you have <br/>a big brown
          tail?&quot; He wouldn't let go of the coat. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Chilton wants you in his office, right now,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;No I don't,&quot; Dr.
          Chilton said. &quot;Put the coat in the closet, Alan, and don't get it out <br/></p>
        <p>while we're gone.<i> Do it.</i> I had a full-time office girl, but the cutbacks robbed me of her. <br/>Now
          the girl who let you in types three hours a day, and then I have Alan. Where are all <br/>the office girls,
          Miss Starling?&quot; His spectacles flashed at her. &quot;Are you armed?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, I'm not armed.&quot; <br/>&quot;May I see your purse and briefcase?&quot; <br/>&quot;You saw my
          credentials.&quot; <br/>&quot;And they say you're a student. Let me see your things, please.&quot; <br/> <br/>
        </p>
        <p>---------- <br/> <br/>Clarice Starling flinched as the first of the heavy steel gates clashed shut behind
          <br/></p>
        <p>her and the bolt shot home. Chilton walked slightly ahead, down the green institutional <br/>corridor in an
          atmosphere of Lysol and distant slammings. Starling was angry at herself <br/>for letting Chilton put his hand
          in her purse and briefcase, and she stepped hard on the <br/>anger so that she could concentrate. It was all
          right. She felt her control solid beneath her, <br/>like a good gravel bottom in a fast current. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Lecter's a considerable nuisance,&quot; Chilton said over his shoulder. &quot;It takes an <br/>orderly
          at least ten minutes a day to remove the staples from the publications he receives. <br/>We tried to eliminate
          or reduce his subscriptions, but he wrote a brief and the court <br/>overruled us. The volume of his personal
          mail used to be enormous. Thankfully, it's <br/>dwindled since he's been overshadowed by other creatures in
          the news. For a while it <br/>seemed that every little student doing a master's thesis in psychology wanted
          something <br/>from Lecter in it. The medical journals still publish him, but it's just for the freak value of
          <br/>his byline.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He did a good piece on surgical addiction in the <i>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, </i>I </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>thought,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;You did, did you? <i>We </i>tried to study Lecter. We thought,
        'Here's an opportunity <br/></p>
        <p>to make a landmark study'--- it's so rare to get one alive.&quot; <br/>&quot;One what?&quot; <br/>&quot;A
          pure sociopath, that's obviously what he is. But he's impenetrable, much too <br/></p>
        <p>sophisticated for the standard tests. And, my, does he hate us. He thinks I'm his nemesis. <br/>Crawford's
          very clever--- isn't he?--- using you on Lecter. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?&quot; <br/>''A young woman to 'turn him on,' I believe you call it. I
          don't believe Lecter's <br/></p>
        <p>seen a woman in several years--- he may have gotten a glimpse of one of the cleaning <br/>people. We
          generally keep women out of there. They're trouble in detention.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p><i>Well fuck off, Chilton.</i> &quot;I graduated from the University of Virginia with honors, <br/>Doctor.
          It's not a charm school.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Then you should be able to remember the rules: Do not reach through the bars, <br/>do not touch the
          bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper. No pens, no pencils. He has <br/>his own felt-tipped pens some of
          the time. The paper you pass him must be free of <br/>staples, paper clips, or pins. Items are only passed to
          him through the sliding food carrier. <br/>Items come back out through the sliding food carrier. No
          exceptions. Do not accept <br/>anything he attempts to hold out to you through the barrier. Do you understand
          me?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I understand.&quot; <br/>They had passed through two more gates and left the natural light behind. Now
          <br/></p>
        <p>they were beyond the wards where inmates can mix together, down in the region where <br/>there can be no
          windows and no mixing. The hallway lights are covered with heavy grids, <br/>like the lights in the engine
          rooms of ships. Dr. Chilton paused beneath one. When their <br/>footfalls stopped, Starling could hear
          somewhere beyond the wall the ragged end of a <br/>voice ruined by shouting. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Lecter is never outside his cell without wearing full restraints and a mouthpiece,&quot; <br/>Chilton
          said. &quot;I'm going to show you why. He was a model of cooperation for the first <br/>year after he was
          committed. Security around him was slightly relaxed--- this was under <br/>the previous administration, you
          understand. On the afternoon of July 8, 1976, he <br/>complained of chest pain and he was taken to the
          dispensary. His restraints were removed <br/>to make it easier to give him an electrocardiogram. When the
          nurse bent over him, he did <br/>this to her.&quot; Chilton handed Clarice Starling a dog-eared photograph.
          &quot;The doctors <br/>managed to save one of her eyes. Lecter was hooked up to the monitors the entire time.
          <br/>He broke her jaw to get at her tongue. His pulse never got over eighty-five, even when he <br/>swallowed
          it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling didn't know which was worse, the photograph or Chilton's attention as he <br/>gleaned her face with
          fast grabby eyes. She thought of a thirsty chicken pecking tears off <br/>her face. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I keep him in here,&quot; Chilton said, and pushed a button beside heavy double doors <br/>of security
          glass. A big orderly let them into the block beyond. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling made a tough decision and stopped just inside the doors. &quot;Dr. Chilton, we <br/>really need
          these test results. If Dr. Lecter feels you're his enemy--- if he's fixed on you, <br/>just as you've said---
          we might have more luck if I approached him by myself. What do <br/>you think?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Chilton's cheek twitched. &quot;That's perfectly fine with me. You might have </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>suggested that in my office. I could have sent an orderly with you and saved the time.&quot; <br/>&quot;I
        could have suggested it there if you'd briefed me there.&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't expect I'll see you again,
        Miss <i>Star</i>ling--- Barney, when she's finished <br/></p>
        <p>with Lecter, ring for someone to bring her out.&quot; <br/>Chilton left without looking at her again. <br/>Now
          there was only the big impassive orderly and the soundless clock behind him <br/></p>
        <p>and his wire mesh cabinet with the Mace and restraints, mouthpiece and tranquilizer gun. <br/>A wall rack
          held a long pipe device with a U on the end for pinioning the violent to the <br/>wall. <br/></p>
        <p>The orderly was looking at her. &quot;Dr. Chilton told you, don't touch the bars?&quot; His <br/>voice was
          both high and hoarse. She was reminded of Aldo Ray. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, he told me.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay. It's past the others, the last cell on the right. Stay toward
          the middle of the <br/></p>
        <p>corridor as you go down, and don't mind anything. You can take him his mail, get off on <br/>the right foot.&quot;
          The orderly seemed privately amused. &quot;You just put it in the tray and let it <br/>roll through. If the
          tray's inside, you can pull it back with the cord, or he can send it back. <br/>He can't reach you where the
          tray stops outside.&quot; The orderly gave her two magazines, <br/>their loose pages spilling out, three
          newspapers and several opened letters. <br/></p>
        <p>The corridor was about thirty yards long, with cells on both sides. Some were <br/>padded cells with an
          observation window, long and narrow like an archery slit; in the <br/>center of the door. Others were standard
          prison cells, with a wall of bars opening on the <br/>corridor. Clarice Starling was aware of figures in the
          cells, but she tried not to look at <br/>them. She was more than halfway down when a voice hissed, &quot;I can
          smell your cunt.&quot; <br/>She gave no sign that she had heard it, and went on. <br/></p>
        <p>The lights were on in the last cell. She moved toward the left side of the corridor <br/>to see into it as
          she approached, knowing her heels announced her. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>Chapter 3 <br/> <br/>D</b>r. Lecter's cell is well beyond the others, facing only a closet
          across the corridor, <br/></p>
        <p>and it is unique in ether ways. The front is a wall of bars, but within the bars, at a distance <br/>greater
          than the human reach, is a second barrier, a stout nylon net stretched from floor to <br/>ceiling and wall to
          wall. Behind the net, Starling could see a table bolted to the floor and <br/>piled high with softcover books
          and papers, and a straight chair, also fastened down. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Hannibal Lecter himself reclined on his bunk, perusing the Italian edition of <br/><i>Vogue</i>. He held
          the loose pages in his right hand and put them beside him one by one <br/>with his left. Dr. Lecter has six
          fingers on his left hand. <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice Starling stopped a little distance from the bars, about the length of a small <br/>foyer. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter.&quot; Her voice sounded all right to her. <br/>He looked up from his reading. <br/>For a
          steep second she thought his gaze hummed, but it was only her blood she <br/></p>
        <p>heard. <br/>&quot;My name is Clarice Starling. May I talk with you?&quot; Courtesy was implicit in her <br/>
        </p>
        <p>distance and her tone. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Dr. Lecter considered, his finger pressed against his pursed lips. Then he rose in <br/>his own time and
        came forward smoothly in his cage, stopping short of the nylon web <br/>without looking at it, as though he
        chose the distance. <br/></p>
        <p>She could see that he was small, sleek; in his hands and arms she saw wiry <br/>strength like her own. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; he said, as though he had answered the door. His cultured voice <br/>has a slight
          metallic rasp beneath it, possibly from disuse. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter's eyes are maroon and they reflect the light in pinpoints of red. <br/>Sometimes the points of
          light seem to fly like sparks to his center. His eyes held Starling <br/>whole. <br/></p>
        <p>She came a measured distance closer to the bars. The hair on her forearms rose <br/>and pressed against her
          sleeves. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask you for <br/>your help.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot; 'We' being Behavioral Science at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I <br/>expect.&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I am, yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;May I see your credentials?&quot; <br/>She hadn't expected this. &quot;I
          showed them at the... office.&quot; <br/>&quot;You mean you showed them to Frederick Chilton, Ph.D.?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you see <i>his </i>credentials?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;The
          academic ones don't make extensive reading, I can tell you. Did you meet <br/></p>
        <p>Alan? Isn't he charming? Which of them had you rather talk with?&quot; <br/>&quot;On the whole, I'd say Alan.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;You could be a reporter Chilton let in for money. I think I'm entitled to see your <br/></p>
        <p>credentials.&quot; <br/>&quot;All right.&quot; She held up her laminated ID card. <br/>&quot;I can't read it
          at this distance, send it through, please.&quot; <br/>&quot;I can't.&quot; <br/>&quot;Because it's hard.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Ask Barney.&quot; <br/>The orderly came and considered. &quot;Dr. Lecter,
          I'll let this come through. But if <br/></p>
        <p>you don't return it when I ask you to--- if we have to bother everybody and secure you to <br/>get it--- then
          I'll be upset. If you upset me, you'll have to stay bundled up until I feel <br/>better toward you. Meals
          through the tube, dignity pants changed twice a day--- the <br/>works. And I'll hold your mail for a week. Got
          it?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Certainly, Barney.&quot; <br/>The card rolled through on the tray and Dr. Lecter held it to the light.
          <br/>&quot;A trainee? It says 'trainee.' Jack Crawford sent a <i>trainee </i>to interview me?&quot; He <br/>
        </p>
        <p>tapped the card against his small white teeth and breathed in its smell. <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter,&quot; Barney
          said. <br/>&quot;Of course.&quot; He put the card back in the tray carrier and Barney pulled it to the <br/>
        </p>
        <p>outside. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;I'm still in training at the Academy, yes,&quot; Starling said, &quot;but we're not discussing <br/>the
        FBI--- we're talking psychology. Can you decide for yourself if I'm qualified in what <br/>we talk about?&quot;
        <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Ummmm,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. &quot;Actually... that's rather slippery of you. Barney, do <br/>you
          think Officer Starling might have a chair?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Chilton didn't tell me anything about a chair.&quot; <br/>&quot;What do your manners tell you,
          Barney?&quot; <br/>&quot;Would you like a chair?&quot; Barney asked her. &quot;We could have had one, but he
          <br/></p>
        <p>never--- well, usually nobody needs to stay that long.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; Starling said.
          <br/>Barney brought a folding chair from the locked closet across the hall, set it up, <br/></p>
        <p>and left them. <br/>&quot;Now,&quot; Lecter said, sitting sideways at his table to face her, &quot;what did
          Miggs say <br/></p>
        <p>to you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Who?&quot; <br/>&quot;Multiple Miggs, in the cell down there. He hissed at you. What
          did he say?&quot; <br/>&quot;He said, 'I can smell your cunt.&quot;' <br/>&quot;I see. I myself cannot. You
          use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air <br/></p>
        <p>du Temps, but not today. Today you are determinedly unperfumed. How do you feel <br/>about what Miggs said?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He's hostile for reasons I couldn't know. It's too bad. He's hostile to people, <br/>people are hostile
          to him. It's a loop.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Are you hostile to him?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm sorry he's disturbed. Beyond that, he's noise. How did you
          know about the <br/></p>
        <p>perfume?&quot; <br/>&quot;A puff from your bag when you got out your card. Your bag is lovely.&quot; <br/>&quot;Thank
          you.&quot; <br/>&quot;You brought your best bag, didn't you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; It was true. She had
          saved for the classic casual handbag, and it was the <br/></p>
        <p>best item she owned. <br/>&quot;It's much better than your shoes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Maybe they'll catch up.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I have no doubt of it.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you do the drawings on your walls, Doctor?&quot; <br/>&quot;Do
          you think I called in a decorator?&quot; <br/>&quot;The one over the sink is a European city?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's
          Florence. That's the Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo, seen from the <br/></p>
        <p>Belvedere.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you do it from memory, all the detail?&quot; <br/>&quot;Memory, Officer
          Starling, is what I have instead of a view.&quot; <br/>&quot;The other one is a crucifixion? The middle cross
          is empty.' <br/>&quot;It's Golgotha after the Deposition. Crayon and Magic Marker on butcher paper. <br/></p>

          cuts here. I brought---&quot; <br/>&quot;No. No, that's stupid and wrong. Never use wit in a segue. Listen,
          understanding <br/></p>
        <p>a witticism and replying to it makes your subject perform a fast, detached scan that is <br/>inimical to
          mood. It is on the plank of mood that we proceed. You were doing fine, you'd <br/>been courteous and receptive
          to courtesy, you'd established trust by telling the <br/>embarrassing truth about Miggs, and then you come in
          with a ham-handed segue into <br/>your questionnaire, It won't do.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter, you're an experienced clinical psychiatrist. Do you think I'm dumb <br/>enough to try to
          run some kind of mood scam on you? Give me some credit. I'm asking <br/>you to respond to the questionnaire,
          and you will or you won't. Would it hurt to look at <br/>the thing?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Officer Starling, have you read any of the papers coming out of Behavioral <br/>Science recently?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;So have I. The FBI stupidly refuses to send me the <i>Law Enforcement Bulletin,
          <br/></i></p>
        <p>but I get it from secondhand dealers and I have the <i>News </i>from John Jay, and the <br/>psychiatric
          journals. They're dividing the people who practice serial murder into two <br/>groups--- organized and
          disorganized. What do you think of that?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;It's... fundamental, they evidently---&quot; <br/><i>&quot;Simplistic</i> is the word you want. In
          fact, most psychology is puerile, Officer <br/></p>
        <p>Starling, and that practiced in Behavioral Science is on a level with phrenology. <br/>Psychology doesn't get
          very good material to start with. Go to any college psychology <br/>department and look at the students and
          faculty: ham radio enthusiasts and other <br/>personality-deficient buffs. Hardly the best brains on the
          campus: <i>Organized </i>and <br/><i>disorganized--- </i>a real bottom-feeder thought of that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How would you change the classification?&quot; <br/>&quot;I wouldn't.&quot; <br/>&quot;Speaking of
          publications, I read your pieces on surgical addiction and left-side, <br/></p>
        <p>right-side facial displays.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, they were first-rate,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. <br/>&quot;I
          thought so, and so did Jack Crawford. He pointed them out to me. That's one <br/></p>
        <p>reason he's anxious for you---&quot; <br/>&quot;Crawford the Stoic is anxious? He must be busy if he's
          recruiting help from the <br/></p>
        <p>student body.&quot; <br/>&quot;He is, and he wants---&quot; <br/>&quot;Busy with Buffalo Bill.&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          expect so.&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;No. Not 'I expect so.' Officer Starling, you know perfectly well it's Buffalo Bill. I <br/>thought
        Jack Crawford might have sent you to ask me about that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Then you're not working around to it.&quot; <br/>&quot;No, I came because we need

          material on that case, my <br/></p>
        <p>job is---&quot; <br/>&quot;How many women has Buffalo Bill used?&quot; <br/>&quot;The police have found five.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;All flayed?&quot; <br/>&quot;Partially, yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;The papers have never explained his
          name. Do you know why he's called <br/></p>
        <p>Buffalo Bill?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Tell me.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll tell you if you'll look
          at this questionnaire.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll look, that's all. Now, why?&quot; <br/>&quot;It started as a bad
          joke in Kansas City homicide.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes...?&quot; <br/>&quot;They call him Buffalo Bill because he
          skins his humps.&quot; <br/>Starling discovered that she had traded feeling frightened for feeling cheap. Of
          the <br/></p>
        <p>two, she preferred feeling frightened. <br/>&quot;Send through the questionnaire.&quot; <br/>Starling rolled
          the blue section through on the tray. She sat still while Lecter <br/></p>
        <p>flipped through it. <br/>He dropped it back in the carrier. &quot;Oh, Officer Starling, do you think you can
          <br/></p>
        <p>dissect me with this blunt little tool?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, I think you can provide some insight and advance
          this study.&quot; <br/>&quot;And what possible reason could I have to do that?&quot; <br/>&quot;Curiosity.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;About what?&quot; <br/>&quot;About why you're here. About what happened to you.&quot; <br/>&quot;Nothing
          happened to me, Officer Starling. <i>I</i> happened. You can't reduce me to a <br/></p>
        <p>set of influences. You've given up good and evil for behaviorism, Officer Starling. <br/>You've got everybody
          in moral dignity pants--- nothing is ever anybody's fault. Look at <br/>me, Officer Starling. Can you stand to
          say I'm evil? Am I evil, Officer Starling?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I think you've been destructive. For me it's the same thing.&quot; <br/>&quot;Evil's just destructive?
          Then <i>storms </i>are evil, if it's that simple. And we have <i>fire</i>, <br/></p>
        <p>and then there's <i>hail</i>. Underwriters lump it all under 'Acts of God.' &quot; <br/>&quot;Deliberate---&quot;

        <br/>He stopped her with his upraised hand. The hand was shapely, she noted, and the <br/></p>
        <p>middle finger perfectly replicated. It is the rarest form of polydactyly. <br/>When he spoke again, his tone
          was soft and pleasant. &quot;You'd like to quantify me, <br/></p>
        <p>Officer Starling. You're so ambitious, aren't you? Do you know what you look like to me, <br/>with your good
          bag and your cheap shoes? You look like a rube. You're a well-scrubbed, <br/>hustling rube with a little
          taste. Your eyes are like cheap birthstones--- all surface shine <br/>when you stalk some little answer. And
          you're bright behind them, aren't you? Desperate <br/>not to be like your mother. Good nutrition has given you
          some length of bone, but you're <br/>not more than one generation out of the mines, <i>Officer </i>Starling.
          Is it the West Virginia <br/>Starlings or the Okie Starlings, Officer? It was a toss-up between college and
          the op-<br/>portunities in the Women's Army Corps, wasn't it? Let me tell you something specific <br/>about
          yourself, Student Starling. Back in your room, you have a string of gold add-a-<br/>beads and you feel an ugly
          little thump when you look at how tacky they are now, isn't <br/>that so? All those tedious thank-yous,
          permitting all that sincere fumbling, getting all <br/>sticky once for every bead. Tedious. Tedious.
          Bo-o-o-o-r-i-ing. Being smart spoils a lot <br/>of things, doesn't it? And, taste isn't kind. When you think
          about this conversation, you'll <br/>remember the dumb animal hurt in his face when you got rid of him. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;If the add-a-beads got tacky, what else will as you go along? You wonder don't <br/>you, at night?&quot;
          Dr. Lecter asked in the kindest of tones. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling raised her head to face him. &quot;You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. I won't deny <br/>anything you've
          said. But here's the question you're answering for me right now, whether <br/>you mean to or not: Are you
          strong enough to point that high-powered perception at <br/>yourself? It's hard to face. I've found that out
          in the last few minutes. How about it? Look <br/>at yourself and write down the truth. What more fit or
          complex subject could you find? <br/>Or maybe you're afraid of yourself.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You're tough, aren't you, Officer Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Reasonably so, yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;And
          you'd hate to think you were common. Would'nt that sting? My! Well you're <br/></p>
        <p>far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is fear of it. What are your add-a-beads, <br/>seven
          millimeter?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Seven.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let me make a suggestion. Get some loose, drilled tiger's eyes and string them
          <br/></p>
        <p>alternately with the gold beads. You might want to do two-and-three or one-and-two, <br/>however looks best
          to you. The tiger's eyes will pick up the color of your own eyes and <br/>the highlights in your hair. Has
          anyone ever sent you a Valentine?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yep.&quot; <br/>&quot;We're already into Lent. Valentine's Day is only a week away, hmmmm, are you
          <br/></p>
        <p>expecting some?&quot; <br/>&quot;You never know.&quot; <br/>&quot;No, you never do... I've been thinking
          about Valentine's Day. It reminds me of <br/></p>
        <p>something funny. Now that I think of it, I could make you very happy on Valentine's <br/>Day, <i>Clarice </i>Starling.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How, Doctor Lecter?&quot; <br/>&quot;By sending you a wonderful Valentine. I'll have to think about it.
          Now please </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>excuse me. Good-bye, Officer Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;And the study?&quot; <br/>&quot;A census taker
        tried to quantify me once. I ate his liver with some fava beans and <br/></p>
        <p>a big Amarone. Go back to school, little Starling.&quot; <br/>Hannibal Lecter, polite to the last, did not
          give her his back. He stepped backward <br/></p>
        <p>from the barrier before he turned to his cot again, and lying on it, became as remote from <br/>her as a
          stone crusader lying on a tomb. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling felt suddenly empty, as though she had given blood. She took longer than <br/>necessary to put the
          papers back in her briefcase because she didn't immediately trust her <br/>legs. Starling was soaked with the
          failure she detested. She folded her chair and leaned it <br/>against the utility closet door. She would have
          to pass Miggs again. Barney in the <br/>distance appeared to be reading. She could call him to come for her.
          Damn Miggs. It was <br/>no worse than passing construction crews or delivery louts every day in the city. She
          <br/>started back down the corridor. <br/></p>
        <p>Close beside her, Miggs' voice hissed, &quot;I bit my wrist so I can diiiieeeeeeeee--- <br/>see how it
          bleeds?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>She should have called Barney but, startled, she looked into the cell, saw Miggs <br/>flick his fingers and
          felt the warm spatter on her cheek and shoulder before she could turn <br/>away. <br/></p>
        <p>She got away from him, registered that it was semen, not blood, and Lecter was <br/>calling to her, she could
          hear him. Dr. Lecter's voice behind her, the cutting rasp in it <br/>more pronounced. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Officer Starling.&quot; <br/>He was up and calling after her as she walked. She rummaged in her purse
          for <br/></p>
        <p>tissues. <br/>Behind her, &quot;Officer Starling.&quot; <br/>She was on the cold rails of her control now,
          making steady progress toward the <br/></p>
        <p>gate. <br/>&quot;Officer Starling.&quot; A new note in Lecter's voice. <br/>She stopped. <i>What in God's
          name do I want this bad? </i>Miggs hissed something <br/></p>
        <p>she didn't listen to. <br/>She stood again in front of Letter's cell and saw the rare spectacle of the doctor
          <br/></p>
        <p>agitated. She knew that he could smell it on her. He could smell everything. <br/>&quot;I would not have had
          that happen to you. Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to <br/></p>
        <p>me.&quot; <br/>It was as though committing murders had purged him of lesser rudeness. Or <br/></p>
        <p>perhaps, Starling thought, it excited him to see her marked in this particular way. She <br/>couldn't tell.
          The sparks in his eyes flew into his darkness like fireflies down a cave. <br/></p>
        <p><i>Whatever it is, use it, Jesus!</i> She held up her briefcase. &quot;Please do this for me.&quot; <br/>Maybe
          she was too late; he was calm again. <br/>&quot;No. But I'll make you happy that you came. I'll give you
          something else. I'll give <br/></p>
        <p>you what you love the most, Clarice Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;What's that, Dr. Lecter?&quot; <br/>&quot;Advancement,
          of course. It works out perfectly--- I'm so glad. Valentine's Day <br/></p>
        <p>made me a think of it.&quot; The smile over white teeth could have come for any reason. He <br/>spoke so
          softly she could barely hear. &quot;Look in Raspail's car for your Valentines. Did you </p>
