      <h2>The Silence of the Lambs</h2>
      <p>Behavioral Science, the FBI section that deals with serial murder, is on the bottom
floor of the Academy building at Quantico, half-buried in the earth. Clarice Starling
reached it flushed after a fast walk from Hogan's Alley on the firing range. She had grass
in her hair and grass stains on her FBI Academy windbreaker from diving to the ground
under fire in an arrest problem on the range.</p>
