      <div><p><b>CHAPTER 1 <br/> <br/>B</b>ehavioral Science, the FBI section that deals with serial murder, is on the
        bottom <br/></p>
        <p>floor of the Academy building at Quantico, half-buried in the earth. Clarice Starling <br/>reached it flushed
          after a fast walk from Hogan's Alley on the firing range. She had grass <br/>in her hair and grass stains on
          her FBI Academy windbreaker from diving to the ground <br/>under fire in an arrest problem on the range. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>No one was in the outer office, so she fluffed briefly by her reflection in the glass <br/>doors. She knew
          she could look all right without primping. Her hands smelled of <br/>gunsmoke, but there was no time to
          wash--- Section Chief Crawford's summons had said <br/>now. <br/></p>
        <p>She found Jack Crawford alone in the cluttered suite of offices. He was standing <br/>at someone else's desk
          talking on the telephone and she had a chance to look him over for <br/>the first time in a year. What she saw
          disturbed her. <br/></p>
        <p>Normally, Crawford looked like a fit, middle-aged engineer who might have paid <br/>his way through college
          playing baseball--- a crafty catcher, tough when he blocked the <br/>plate. Now he was thin, his shirt collar
          was too big, and he had dark puffs under his <br/>reddened eyes. Everyone who could read the papers knew
          Behavioral Science section <br/>was catching hell. Starling hoped Crawford wasn't on the juice. That seemed
          most <br/>unlikely here. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford ended his telephone conversation with a sharp &quot;No.&quot; He took her file <br/>from under his
          arm and opened it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Starling, Clarice M., good morning,&quot; he said. <br/>&quot;Hello.&quot; Her smile was only polite.
          <br/>&quot;Nothing's wrong. I hope the call didn't spook you.&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <i>Not totally
            true, </i>Starling thought. <br/>&quot;Your instructors tell me you're doing well, top quarter of the class.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I hope so, they haven't posted anything.&quot; <br/>&quot;I ask them from time to time.&quot; <br/>That
          surprised Starling; she had written Crawford off as a two-faced recruiting <br/></p>
        <p>sergeant son of a bitch. <br/>She had met Special Agent Crawford when he was a guest lecturer at the <br/>
        </p>
        <p>University of Virginia. The quality of his criminology seminars was a factor in her <br/>coming to the
          Bureau. She wrote him a note when she qualified for the Academy, but he <br/>never replied, and for the three
          months she had been a trainee at Quantico, he had ignored <br/>her. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling came from people who do not ask for favors or press for friendship, but <br/>she was puzzled and
          regretful at Crawford's behavior. Now, in his presence, she liked <br/>him again, she was sorry to note. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Clearly something was wrong with him. There was a peculiar cleverness in <br/>Crawford, aside from his
          intelligence, and Starling had first noticed it in his color sense <br/>and the textures of his clothing, even
          within the FBI-clone standards of agent dress. Now <br/>he was neat but drab, as though he were molting. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;A job came up and I thought about you,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not really a job, it's more <br/>of an
          interesting errand. Push Berry's stuff off that chair and sit down. You put down here <br/>that you want to
          come directly to Behavioral Science when you get through with the </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Academy.&quot; <br/>&quot;I do.&quot; <br/>&quot;You have a lot of forensics, but no law enforcement
        background. We look for six <br/></p>
        <p>years, minimum.&quot; <br/>&quot;My father was a marshal, I know the life.&quot; <br/>Crawford smiled a
          little. &quot;What you <i>do </i>have is a double major in psychology and <br/></p>
        <p>criminology, and how many summers working in a mental health center--- two?&quot; <br/>&quot;Two.&quot; <br/>&quot;Your
          counselor's license, is it current?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's good for two more years. I got it before you had the
          seminar at UVA--- <br/></p>
        <p>before I decided to do this.&quot; <br/>&quot;You got stuck in the hiring freeze.&quot; <br/>Starling nodded.
          &quot;I was lucky though--- I found out in time to qualify as a <br/></p>
        <p>Forensic Fellow. Then I could work in the lab until the Academy had an opening.&quot; <br/>&quot;You wrote to
          me about coming here, didn't you, and I don't think I answered--- I <br/></p>
        <p>know I didn't. I should have.&quot; <br/>&quot;You've had plenty else to do.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you know
          about VI-CAP?&quot; <br/>&quot;I know it's the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program. The <i>Law Enforcement
            <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>Bulletin </i>says you're working on a database, but you aren't operational yet.&quot; <br/>Crawford
          nodded. &quot;We've developed a questionnaire. It applies to all the known <br/></p>
        <p>serial murderers in modern times.&quot; He handed her a thick sheaf of papers in a flimsy <br/>binding.
          &quot;There's a section for investigators, and one for surviving victims, if any. The <br/>blue is for the
          killer to answer if he will, and the pink is a series of questions an examiner <br/>asks the killer, getting
          his reactions as well as his answers. It's a lot of paperwork.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Paperwork. Clarice Starling's self-interest snuffled ahead like a keen beagle. She <br/>smelled a job offer
          coming--- probably the drudgery of feeding raw data into a new <br/>computer system. It was tempting to get
          into Behavioral Science in any capacity she <br/>could, but she knew what happens to a woman if she's ever
          pegged as a secretary--- it <br/>sticks until the end of time. A choice was coming, and she wanted to choose
          well. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was waiting for something--- he must have asked her a question. <br/>Starling had to scramble to
          recall it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What tests have you given? Minnesota Multiphasic, ever? Rorschach?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, MMPI, never
          Rorschach,&quot; she said. &quot;I've done Thematic Apperception and <br/></p>
        <p>I've given children Bender-Gestalt.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you spook easily, Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Not yet.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;See, we've tried to interview and examine all the thirty-two known serial <br/></p>
        <p>murderers we have in custody, to build up a database for psychological profiling is <br/>unsolved cases. Most
          of them went along with it--- I think they're driven to show off, a <br/>lot of them. Twenty-seven were
          willing to cooperate. Four on death row with appeals <br/>pending clammed up, understandably. But the one we
          want the most, we haven't been <br/>able to get. I want you to go after him tomorrow in the asylum.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice Starling felt a glad knocking in her chest and some apprehension too. <br/>&quot;Who's the subject?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;The psychiatrist--- Dr. Hannibal Lecter,&quot; Crawford said. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>A brief silence follows the name, always, in any civilized gathering. <br/>Starling looked at Crawford
        steadily, but she was too still. &quot;Hannibal the <br/></p>
        <p>Cannibal,&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, well--- Okay, right. I'm glad of the chance,
          but you have to know I'm <br/></p>
        <p>wondering--- why me?&quot; <br/>&quot;Mainly because you're available,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;I don't
          expect him to <br/></p>
        <p>cooperate. He's already refused, but it was through an intermediary--- the director of the <br/>hospital. I
          have to be able to say our qualified examiner went to him and asked him <br/>personally. There are reasons
          that don't concern you. I don't have anybody left in this <br/>section to do it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>' &quot;You're jammed--- Buffalo Bill--- and the things in Nevada,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;You got
          it. It's the old story--- not enough warm bodies.&quot; <br/>&quot;You said tomorrow--- you're in a hurry. Any
          bearing on a current case?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. I wish there were.&quot; <br/>&quot;If he balks on me, do you
          still want a psychological evaluation?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. I'm waist-deep in inaccessible-patient evaluations
          of Dr. Lecter and they're <br/></p>
        <p>all different.&quot; <br/>Crawford shook two vitamin C tablets into his palm, and mixed an Alka-Seltzer at
          <br/></p>
        <p>the water cooler to wash them down. &quot;It's ridiculous, you know; Lecter's a psychiatrist <br/>and he
          writes for the psychiatric journals himself--- extraordinary stuff--- but it's never <br/>about his own little
          anomalies. He pretended to go along with the hospital director, <br/>Chilton, once in some tests--- sitting
          around with a blood-pressure cuff on his penis, <br/>looking at wreck pictures--- then Lecter published first
          what he'd learned about Chilton <br/>and made a fool out of him. He responds to serious correspondence from
          psychiatric <br/>students in fields unrelated to his case, and that's all he does. If he won't talk to you, I
          just <br/>want straight reporting. How does he look, how does his cell look, what's he doing. Local <br/>color,
          so to speak. Watch out for the press going in and coming out. Not the real press, <br/>the supermarket press.
          They love Lecter even better than Prince Andrew.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Didn't a sleazo magazine offer him fifty thousand dollars for some recipes? I <br/>seem to remember
          that,&quot; Starling said. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford nodded. &quot;I'm pretty sure the <i>National Tattler </i>has bought somebody <br/>inside the
          hospital and they may know you're coming after I make the appointment.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford leaned forward until he faced her at a distance of two feet. She watched <br/>his half-glasses blur
          the bags under his eyes. He had gargled recently with Listerine. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton, the head of the mental <br/></p>
        <p>hospital, will go over the physical procedure you use to deal with him. Don't deviate from <br/>it. <i>Do not
          deviate from it one iota for any reason. </i>If Lecter talks to you at all, he'll just be <br/>trying to find
          out about you. It's the kind of curiosity that makes a snake look in a bird's <br/>nest. We both know you have
          to back-and-forth a little in interviews, but you tell him no <br/>specifics about yourself. You don't want
          any of your personal facts in his head. You <br/>know what he did to Will Graham.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I read about it when it happened.&quot; <br/>&quot;He gutted Will with a linoleum knife when Will
          caught up with him. It's a </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>wonder Will didn't die. Remember the Red Dragon? Lecter turned Francis Dolarhyde <br/>onto Will and his
        family. Will's face looks like damn Picasso drew him, thanks to Lecter. <br/>He tore a nurse up in the asylum.
        Do your job, just don't ever forget what he is.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;And what's that? Do you know?&quot; <br/>&quot;I know he's a monster. Beyond that, nobody can say for
          sure. Maybe you'll find <br/></p>
        <p>out; I didn't pick you out of a hat, Starling. You asked me a couple of interesting <br/>questions when I was
          at UVA. The Director will see your own report over your signature-<br/>-- if it's clear and tight and
          organized. I decide that. And I <i>will </i>have it by 0900 Sunday. <br/>Okay, Starling, carry on in the
          prescribed manner.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford smiled at her, but his eyes were dead. <br/> <br/></p>
        <p><b> <br/>CHAPTER 2 <br/> <br/>D</b>r. Frederick Chilton, fifty-eight, administrator of the Baltimore State
          Hospital <br/></p>
        <p>for the Criminally Insane, has a long, wide desk upon which there are no hard or sharp <br/>objects. Some of
          the staff call it &quot;the moat.&quot; Other staff members don't know what the <br/>word <i>moat </i>means.
          Dr. Chilton remained seated behind his desk when Clarice Starling <br/>came into his office. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;We've had a lot of detectives here, but I can't remember one so attractive,&quot; <br/>Chilton 'said
          without getting up. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling knew without thinking about it that the shine on his extended hand was <br/>lanolin from patting his
          hair. She let go before he did. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;It is <i>Miss </i>Sterling, isn't it?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's <i>Star</i>ling, Doctor, with an <i>a</i>.
          Thank you for your time.&quot; <br/>&quot;So the FBI is going to the girls like everything else, ha, ha.&quot;
          He added the <br/></p>
        <p>tobacco smile he uses to separate his sentences. <br/>&quot;The Bureau's improving, Dr. Chilton. It certainly
          is.&quot; <br/>&quot;Will you be in Baltimore for several days? You know, you can have just as good <br/></p>
        <p>a time here as you can in Washington or New York, if you know the town.&quot; <br/>She looked away to spare
          herself his smile and knew at once that he had <br/></p>
        <p>registered her distaste. &quot;I'm sure it's a great town, but my instructions are to see Dr. <br/>Lecter and
          report back this afternoon.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Is there someplace I could call you in Washington for a follow-up, later on?&quot; <br/>&quot;Of
          course. It's kind of you to think of it. Special Agent Jack Crawford's in charge <br/></p>
        <p>of this project, and you can always reach me through him.&quot; <br/>&quot;I see,&quot; Chilton said. His
          cheeks, mottled with pink, clashed with the improbable <br/></p>
        <p>red-brown of his coif. ''Give me your identification, please.&quot; He let her remain standing <br/>through
          his leisurely examination of her ID card. Then he handed it back and rose. &quot;This <br/>won't take much
          time. Come along.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I understood you'd brief me, Dr. Chilton,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;I can do that while we walk.&quot;
          He came around his desk, looking at his watch. &quot;I <br/></p>
        <p>have a lunch in half an hour.&quot; <br/><i>Dammit, she should have read him better, quicker. He might not be
          a total jerk. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>He might know something useful. It wouldn't have hurt her to simper once, even if she <br/>wasn't at it.

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;Dr. Chilton, I have an appointment with you now. It was set at your convenience, <br/>when you could
        give me some time. Things could come up during the interview--- I may <br/>need to go over some of his responses
        with you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I really, really doubt it. Oh, I need to make a telephone call before we go. I'll <br/>catch up with
          you in the outer office.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'd like to leave my coat and umbrella here.&quot; <br/>&quot;Out there,&quot; Chilton said. &quot;Give
          them to Alan in the outer office. He'll put them <br/></p>
        <p>away.&quot; <br/>Alan wore the pajamalike garment issued to the inmates. He was wiping out <br/></p>
        <p>ashtrays with the tail of his shirt. <br/>He rolled his tongue around in his cheek as he took Starling's
          coat. <br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;You're more than welcome. How often do you shit?&quot;
          Alan asked. <br/>&quot;What did you say?&quot; <br/>&quot;Does it come out lo-o-o-o-nnng?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll
          hang these somewhere myself.&quot; <br/>&quot;You don't have anything in the way--- you can bend over and
          watch it come out <br/></p>
        <p>and see if it changes color when the air hits it, do you do that? Does it look like you have <br/>a big brown
          tail?&quot; He wouldn't let go of the coat. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Chilton wants you in his office, right now,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;No I don't,&quot; Dr.
          Chilton said. &quot;Put the coat in the closet, Alan, and don't get it out <br/></p>
        <p>while we're gone.<i> Do it.</i> I had a full-time office girl, but the cutbacks robbed me of her. <br/>Now
          the girl who let you in types three hours a day, and then I have Alan. Where are all <br/>the office girls,
          Miss Starling?&quot; His spectacles flashed at her. &quot;Are you armed?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, I'm not armed.&quot; <br/>&quot;May I see your purse and briefcase?&quot; <br/>&quot;You saw my
          credentials.&quot; <br/>&quot;And they say you're a student. Let me see your things, please.&quot; <br/> <br/>
        </p>
        <p>---------- <br/> <br/>Clarice Starling flinched as the first of the heavy steel gates clashed shut behind
          <br/></p>
        <p>her and the bolt shot home. Chilton walked slightly ahead, down the green institutional <br/>corridor in an
          atmosphere of Lysol and distant slammings. Starling was angry at herself <br/>for letting Chilton put his hand
          in her purse and briefcase, and she stepped hard on the <br/>anger so that she could concentrate. It was all
          right. She felt her control solid beneath her, <br/>like a good gravel bottom in a fast current. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Lecter's a considerable nuisance,&quot; Chilton said over his shoulder. &quot;It takes an <br/>orderly
          at least ten minutes a day to remove the staples from the publications he receives. <br/>We tried to eliminate
          or reduce his subscriptions, but he wrote a brief and the court <br/>overruled us. The volume of his personal
          mail used to be enormous. Thankfully, it's <br/>dwindled since he's been overshadowed by other creatures in
          the news. For a while it <br/>seemed that every little student doing a master's thesis in psychology wanted
          something <br/>from Lecter in it. The medical journals still publish him, but it's just for the freak value of
          <br/>his byline.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He did a good piece on surgical addiction in the <i>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, </i>I </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>thought,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;You did, did you? <i>We </i>tried to study Lecter. We thought,
        'Here's an opportunity <br/></p>
        <p>to make a landmark study'--- it's so rare to get one alive.&quot; <br/>&quot;One what?&quot; <br/>&quot;A
          pure sociopath, that's obviously what he is. But he's impenetrable, much too <br/></p>
        <p>sophisticated for the standard tests. And, my, does he hate us. He thinks I'm his nemesis. <br/>Crawford's
          very clever--- isn't he?--- using you on Lecter. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?&quot; <br/>''A young woman to 'turn him on,' I believe you call it. I
          don't believe Lecter's <br/></p>
        <p>seen a woman in several years--- he may have gotten a glimpse of one of the cleaning <br/>people. We
          generally keep women out of there. They're trouble in detention.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p><i>Well fuck off, Chilton.</i> &quot;I graduated from the University of Virginia with honors, <br/>Doctor.
          It's not a charm school.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Then you should be able to remember the rules: Do not reach through the bars, <br/>do not touch the
          bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper. No pens, no pencils. He has <br/>his own felt-tipped pens some of
          the time. The paper you pass him must be free of <br/>staples, paper clips, or pins. Items are only passed to
          him through the sliding food carrier. <br/>Items come back out through the sliding food carrier. No
          exceptions. Do not accept <br/>anything he attempts to hold out to you through the barrier. Do you understand
          me?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I understand.&quot; <br/>They had passed through two more gates and left the natural light behind. Now
          <br/></p>
        <p>they were beyond the wards where inmates can mix together, down in the region where <br/>there can be no
          windows and no mixing. The hallway lights are covered with heavy grids, <br/>like the lights in the engine
          rooms of ships. Dr. Chilton paused beneath one. When their <br/>footfalls stopped, Starling could hear
          somewhere beyond the wall the ragged end of a <br/>voice ruined by shouting. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Lecter is never outside his cell without wearing full restraints and a mouthpiece,&quot; <br/>Chilton
          said. &quot;I'm going to show you why. He was a model of cooperation for the first <br/>year after he was
          committed. Security around him was slightly relaxed--- this was under <br/>the previous administration, you
          understand. On the afternoon of July 8, 1976, he <br/>complained of chest pain and he was taken to the
          dispensary. His restraints were removed <br/>to make it easier to give him an electrocardiogram. When the
          nurse bent over him, he did <br/>this to her.&quot; Chilton handed Clarice Starling a dog-eared photograph.
          &quot;The doctors <br/>managed to save one of her eyes. Lecter was hooked up to the monitors the entire time.
          <br/>He broke her jaw to get at her tongue. His pulse never got over eighty-five, even when he <br/>swallowed
          it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling didn't know which was worse, the photograph or Chilton's attention as he <br/>gleaned her face with
          fast grabby eyes. She thought of a thirsty chicken pecking tears off <br/>her face. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I keep him in here,&quot; Chilton said, and pushed a button beside heavy double doors <br/>of security
          glass. A big orderly let them into the block beyond. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling made a tough decision and stopped just inside the doors. &quot;Dr. Chilton, we <br/>really need
          these test results. If Dr. Lecter feels you're his enemy--- if he's fixed on you, <br/>just as you've said---
          we might have more luck if I approached him by myself. What do <br/>you think?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Chilton's cheek twitched. &quot;That's perfectly fine with me. You might have </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>suggested that in my office. I could have sent an orderly with you and saved the time.&quot; <br/>&quot;I
        could have suggested it there if you'd briefed me there.&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't expect I'll see you again,
        Miss <i>Star</i>ling--- Barney, when she's finished <br/></p>
        <p>with Lecter, ring for someone to bring her out.&quot; <br/>Chilton left without looking at her again. <br/>Now
          there was only the big impassive orderly and the soundless clock behind him <br/></p>
        <p>and his wire mesh cabinet with the Mace and restraints, mouthpiece and tranquilizer gun. <br/>A wall rack
          held a long pipe device with a U on the end for pinioning the violent to the <br/>wall. <br/></p>
        <p>The orderly was looking at her. &quot;Dr. Chilton told you, don't touch the bars?&quot; His <br/>voice was
          both high and hoarse. She was reminded of Aldo Ray. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, he told me.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay. It's past the others, the last cell on the right. Stay toward
          the middle of the <br/></p>
        <p>corridor as you go down, and don't mind anything. You can take him his mail, get off on <br/>the right foot.&quot;
          The orderly seemed privately amused. &quot;You just put it in the tray and let it <br/>roll through. If the
          tray's inside, you can pull it back with the cord, or he can send it back. <br/>He can't reach you where the
          tray stops outside.&quot; The orderly gave her two magazines, <br/>their loose pages spilling out, three
          newspapers and several opened letters. <br/></p>
        <p>The corridor was about thirty yards long, with cells on both sides. Some were <br/>padded cells with an
          observation window, long and narrow like an archery slit; in the <br/>center of the door. Others were standard
          prison cells, with a wall of bars opening on the <br/>corridor. Clarice Starling was aware of figures in the
          cells, but she tried not to look at <br/>them. She was more than halfway down when a voice hissed, &quot;I can
          smell your cunt.&quot; <br/>She gave no sign that she had heard it, and went on. <br/></p>
        <p>The lights were on in the last cell. She moved toward the left side of the corridor <br/>to see into it as
          she approached, knowing her heels announced her. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>Chapter 3 <br/> <br/>D</b>r. Lecter's cell is well beyond the others, facing only a closet
          across the corridor, <br/></p>
        <p>and it is unique in ether ways. The front is a wall of bars, but within the bars, at a distance <br/>greater
          than the human reach, is a second barrier, a stout nylon net stretched from floor to <br/>ceiling and wall to
          wall. Behind the net, Starling could see a table bolted to the floor and <br/>piled high with softcover books
          and papers, and a straight chair, also fastened down. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Hannibal Lecter himself reclined on his bunk, perusing the Italian edition of <br/><i>Vogue</i>. He held
          the loose pages in his right hand and put them beside him one by one <br/>with his left. Dr. Lecter has six
          fingers on his left hand. <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice Starling stopped a little distance from the bars, about the length of a small <br/>foyer. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter.&quot; Her voice sounded all right to her. <br/>He looked up from his reading. <br/>For a
          steep second she thought his gaze hummed, but it was only her blood she <br/></p>
        <p>heard. <br/>&quot;My name is Clarice Starling. May I talk with you?&quot; Courtesy was implicit in her <br/>
        </p>
        <p>distance and her tone. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Dr. Lecter considered, his finger pressed against his pursed lips. Then he rose in <br/>his own time and
        came forward smoothly in his cage, stopping short of the nylon web <br/>without looking at it, as though he
        chose the distance. <br/></p>
        <p>She could see that he was small, sleek; in his hands and arms she saw wiry <br/>strength like her own. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; he said, as though he had answered the door. His cultured voice <br/>has a slight
          metallic rasp beneath it, possibly from disuse. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter's eyes are maroon and they reflect the light in pinpoints of red. <br/>Sometimes the points of
          light seem to fly like sparks to his center. His eyes held Starling <br/>whole. <br/></p>
        <p>She came a measured distance closer to the bars. The hair on her forearms rose <br/>and pressed against her
          sleeves. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask you for <br/>your help.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot; 'We' being Behavioral Science at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I <br/>expect.&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I am, yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;May I see your credentials?&quot; <br/>She hadn't expected this. &quot;I
          showed them at the... office.&quot; <br/>&quot;You mean you showed them to Frederick Chilton, Ph.D.?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you see <i>his </i>credentials?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;The
          academic ones don't make extensive reading, I can tell you. Did you meet <br/></p>
        <p>Alan? Isn't he charming? Which of them had you rather talk with?&quot; <br/>&quot;On the whole, I'd say Alan.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;You could be a reporter Chilton let in for money. I think I'm entitled to see your <br/></p>
        <p>credentials.&quot; <br/>&quot;All right.&quot; She held up her laminated ID card. <br/>&quot;I can't read it
          at this distance, send it through, please.&quot; <br/>&quot;I can't.&quot; <br/>&quot;Because it's hard.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Ask Barney.&quot; <br/>The orderly came and considered. &quot;Dr. Lecter,
          I'll let this come through. But if <br/></p>
        <p>you don't return it when I ask you to--- if we have to bother everybody and secure you to <br/>get it--- then
          I'll be upset. If you upset me, you'll have to stay bundled up until I feel <br/>better toward you. Meals
          through the tube, dignity pants changed twice a day--- the <br/>works. And I'll hold your mail for a week. Got
          it?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Certainly, Barney.&quot; <br/>The card rolled through on the tray and Dr. Lecter held it to the light.
          <br/>&quot;A trainee? It says 'trainee.' Jack Crawford sent a <i>trainee </i>to interview me?&quot; He <br/>
        </p>
        <p>tapped the card against his small white teeth and breathed in its smell. <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter,&quot; Barney
          said. <br/>&quot;Of course.&quot; He put the card back in the tray carrier and Barney pulled it to the <br/>
        </p>
        <p>outside. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;I'm still in training at the Academy, yes,&quot; Starling said, &quot;but we're not discussing <br/>the
        FBI--- we're talking psychology. Can you decide for yourself if I'm qualified in what <br/>we talk about?&quot;
        <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Ummmm,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. &quot;Actually... that's rather slippery of you. Barney, do <br/>you
          think Officer Starling might have a chair?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Chilton didn't tell me anything about a chair.&quot; <br/>&quot;What do your manners tell you,
          Barney?&quot; <br/>&quot;Would you like a chair?&quot; Barney asked her. &quot;We could have had one, but he
          <br/></p>
        <p>never--- well, usually nobody needs to stay that long.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; Starling said.
          <br/>Barney brought a folding chair from the locked closet across the hall, set it up, <br/></p>
        <p>and left them. <br/>&quot;Now,&quot; Lecter said, sitting sideways at his table to face her, &quot;what did
          Miggs say <br/></p>
        <p>to you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Who?&quot; <br/>&quot;Multiple Miggs, in the cell down there. He hissed at you. What
          did he say?&quot; <br/>&quot;He said, 'I can smell your cunt.&quot;' <br/>&quot;I see. I myself cannot. You
          use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air <br/></p>
        <p>du Temps, but not today. Today you are determinedly unperfumed. How do you feel <br/>about what Miggs said?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He's hostile for reasons I couldn't know. It's too bad. He's hostile to people, <br/>people are hostile
          to him. It's a loop.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Are you hostile to him?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm sorry he's disturbed. Beyond that, he's noise. How did you
          know about the <br/></p>
        <p>perfume?&quot; <br/>&quot;A puff from your bag when you got out your card. Your bag is lovely.&quot; <br/>&quot;Thank
          you.&quot; <br/>&quot;You brought your best bag, didn't you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; It was true. She had
          saved for the classic casual handbag, and it was the <br/></p>
        <p>best item she owned. <br/>&quot;It's much better than your shoes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Maybe they'll catch up.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I have no doubt of it.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you do the drawings on your walls, Doctor?&quot; <br/>&quot;Do
          you think I called in a decorator?&quot; <br/>&quot;The one over the sink is a European city?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's
          Florence. That's the Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo, seen from the <br/></p>
        <p>Belvedere.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you do it from memory, all the detail?&quot; <br/>&quot;Memory, Officer
          Starling, is what I have instead of a view.&quot; <br/>&quot;The other one is a crucifixion? The middle cross
          is empty.' <br/>&quot;It's Golgotha after the Deposition. Crayon and Magic Marker on butcher paper. <br/></p>

          cuts here. I brought---&quot; <br/>&quot;No. No, that's stupid and wrong. Never use wit in a segue. Listen,
          understanding <br/></p>
        <p>a witticism and replying to it makes your subject perform a fast, detached scan that is <br/>inimical to
          mood. It is on the plank of mood that we proceed. You were doing fine, you'd <br/>been courteous and receptive
          to courtesy, you'd established trust by telling the <br/>embarrassing truth about Miggs, and then you come in
          with a ham-handed segue into <br/>your questionnaire, It won't do.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter, you're an experienced clinical psychiatrist. Do you think I'm dumb <br/>enough to try to
          run some kind of mood scam on you? Give me some credit. I'm asking <br/>you to respond to the questionnaire,
          and you will or you won't. Would it hurt to look at <br/>the thing?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Officer Starling, have you read any of the papers coming out of Behavioral <br/>Science recently?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;So have I. The FBI stupidly refuses to send me the <i>Law Enforcement Bulletin,
          <br/></i></p>
        <p>but I get it from secondhand dealers and I have the <i>News </i>from John Jay, and the <br/>psychiatric
          journals. They're dividing the people who practice serial murder into two <br/>groups--- organized and
          disorganized. What do you think of that?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;It's... fundamental, they evidently---&quot; <br/><i>&quot;Simplistic</i> is the word you want. In
          fact, most psychology is puerile, Officer <br/></p>
        <p>Starling, and that practiced in Behavioral Science is on a level with phrenology. <br/>Psychology doesn't get
          very good material to start with. Go to any college psychology <br/>department and look at the students and
          faculty: ham radio enthusiasts and other <br/>personality-deficient buffs. Hardly the best brains on the
          campus: <i>Organized </i>and <br/><i>disorganized--- </i>a real bottom-feeder thought of that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How would you change the classification?&quot; <br/>&quot;I wouldn't.&quot; <br/>&quot;Speaking of
          publications, I read your pieces on surgical addiction and left-side, <br/></p>
        <p>right-side facial displays.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, they were first-rate,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. <br/>&quot;I
          thought so, and so did Jack Crawford. He pointed them out to me. That's one <br/></p>
        <p>reason he's anxious for you---&quot; <br/>&quot;Crawford the Stoic is anxious? He must be busy if he's
          recruiting help from the <br/></p>
        <p>student body.&quot; <br/>&quot;He is, and he wants---&quot; <br/>&quot;Busy with Buffalo Bill.&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          expect so.&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;No. Not 'I expect so.' Officer Starling, you know perfectly well it's Buffalo Bill. I <br/>thought
        Jack Crawford might have sent you to ask me about that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Then you're not working around to it.&quot; <br/>&quot;No, I came because we need

          material on that case, my <br/></p>
        <p>job is---&quot; <br/>&quot;How many women has Buffalo Bill used?&quot; <br/>&quot;The police have found five.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;All flayed?&quot; <br/>&quot;Partially, yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;The papers have never explained his
          name. Do you know why he's called <br/></p>
        <p>Buffalo Bill?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Tell me.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll tell you if you'll look
          at this questionnaire.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll look, that's all. Now, why?&quot; <br/>&quot;It started as a bad
          joke in Kansas City homicide.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes...?&quot; <br/>&quot;They call him Buffalo Bill because he
          skins his humps.&quot; <br/>Starling discovered that she had traded feeling frightened for feeling cheap. Of
          the <br/></p>
        <p>two, she preferred feeling frightened. <br/>&quot;Send through the questionnaire.&quot; <br/>Starling rolled
          the blue section through on the tray. She sat still while Lecter <br/></p>
        <p>flipped through it. <br/>He dropped it back in the carrier. &quot;Oh, Officer Starling, do you think you can
          <br/></p>
        <p>dissect me with this blunt little tool?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, I think you can provide some insight and advance
          this study.&quot; <br/>&quot;And what possible reason could I have to do that?&quot; <br/>&quot;Curiosity.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;About what?&quot; <br/>&quot;About why you're here. About what happened to you.&quot; <br/>&quot;Nothing
          happened to me, Officer Starling. <i>I</i> happened. You can't reduce me to a <br/></p>
        <p>set of influences. You've given up good and evil for behaviorism, Officer Starling. <br/>You've got everybody
          in moral dignity pants--- nothing is ever anybody's fault. Look at <br/>me, Officer Starling. Can you stand to
          say I'm evil? Am I evil, Officer Starling?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I think you've been destructive. For me it's the same thing.&quot; <br/>&quot;Evil's just destructive?
          Then <i>storms </i>are evil, if it's that simple. And we have <i>fire</i>, <br/></p>
        <p>and then there's <i>hail</i>. Underwriters lump it all under 'Acts of God.' &quot; <br/>&quot;Deliberate---&quot;

        <br/>He stopped her with his upraised hand. The hand was shapely, she noted, and the <br/></p>
        <p>middle finger perfectly replicated. It is the rarest form of polydactyly. <br/>When he spoke again, his tone
          was soft and pleasant. &quot;You'd like to quantify me, <br/></p>
        <p>Officer Starling. You're so ambitious, aren't you? Do you know what you look like to me, <br/>with your good
          bag and your cheap shoes? You look like a rube. You're a well-scrubbed, <br/>hustling rube with a little
          taste. Your eyes are like cheap birthstones--- all surface shine <br/>when you stalk some little answer. And
          you're bright behind them, aren't you? Desperate <br/>not to be like your mother. Good nutrition has given you
          some length of bone, but you're <br/>not more than one generation out of the mines, <i>Officer </i>Starling.
          Is it the West Virginia <br/>Starlings or the Okie Starlings, Officer? It was a toss-up between college and
          the op-<br/>portunities in the Women's Army Corps, wasn't it? Let me tell you something specific <br/>about
          yourself, Student Starling. Back in your room, you have a string of gold add-a-<br/>beads and you feel an ugly
          little thump when you look at how tacky they are now, isn't <br/>that so? All those tedious thank-yous,
          permitting all that sincere fumbling, getting all <br/>sticky once for every bead. Tedious. Tedious.
          Bo-o-o-o-r-i-ing. Being smart spoils a lot <br/>of things, doesn't it? And, taste isn't kind. When you think
          about this conversation, you'll <br/>remember the dumb animal hurt in his face when you got rid of him. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;If the add-a-beads got tacky, what else will as you go along? You wonder don't <br/>you, at night?&quot;
          Dr. Lecter asked in the kindest of tones. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling raised her head to face him. &quot;You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. I won't deny <br/>anything you've
          said. But here's the question you're answering for me right now, whether <br/>you mean to or not: Are you
          strong enough to point that high-powered perception at <br/>yourself? It's hard to face. I've found that out
          in the last few minutes. How about it? Look <br/>at yourself and write down the truth. What more fit or
          complex subject could you find? <br/>Or maybe you're afraid of yourself.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You're tough, aren't you, Officer Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Reasonably so, yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;And
          you'd hate to think you were common. Would'nt that sting? My! Well you're <br/></p>
        <p>far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is fear of it. What are your add-a-beads, <br/>seven
          millimeter?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Seven.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let me make a suggestion. Get some loose, drilled tiger's eyes and string them
          <br/></p>
        <p>alternately with the gold beads. You might want to do two-and-three or one-and-two, <br/>however looks best
          to you. The tiger's eyes will pick up the color of your own eyes and <br/>the highlights in your hair. Has
          anyone ever sent you a Valentine?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yep.&quot; <br/>&quot;We're already into Lent. Valentine's Day is only a week away, hmmmm, are you
          <br/></p>
        <p>expecting some?&quot; <br/>&quot;You never know.&quot; <br/>&quot;No, you never do... I've been thinking
          about Valentine's Day. It reminds me of <br/></p>
        <p>something funny. Now that I think of it, I could make you very happy on Valentine's <br/>Day, <i>Clarice </i>Starling.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How, Doctor Lecter?&quot; <br/>&quot;By sending you a wonderful Valentine. I'll have to think about it.
          Now please </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>excuse me. Good-bye, Officer Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;And the study?&quot; <br/>&quot;A census taker
        tried to quantify me once. I ate his liver with some fava beans and <br/></p>
        <p>a big Amarone. Go back to school, little Starling.&quot; <br/>Hannibal Lecter, polite to the last, did not
          give her his back. He stepped backward <br/></p>
        <p>from the barrier before he turned to his cot again, and lying on it, became as remote from <br/>her as a
          stone crusader lying on a tomb. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling felt suddenly empty, as though she had given blood. She took longer than <br/>necessary to put the
          papers back in her briefcase because she didn't immediately trust her <br/>legs. Starling was soaked with the
          failure she detested. She folded her chair and leaned it <br/>against the utility closet door. She would have
          to pass Miggs again. Barney in the <br/>distance appeared to be reading. She could call him to come for her.
          Damn Miggs. It was <br/>no worse than passing construction crews or delivery louts every day in the city. She
          <br/>started back down the corridor. <br/></p>
        <p>Close beside her, Miggs' voice hissed, &quot;I bit my wrist so I can diiiieeeeeeeee--- <br/>see how it
          bleeds?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>She should have called Barney but, startled, she looked into the cell, saw Miggs <br/>flick his fingers and
          felt the warm spatter on her cheek and shoulder before she could turn <br/>away. <br/></p>
        <p>She got away from him, registered that it was semen, not blood, and Lecter was <br/>calling to her, she could
          hear him. Dr. Lecter's voice behind her, the cutting rasp in it <br/>more pronounced. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Officer Starling.&quot; <br/>He was up and calling after her as she walked. She rummaged in her purse
          for <br/></p>
        <p>tissues. <br/>Behind her, &quot;Officer Starling.&quot; <br/>She was on the cold rails of her control now,
          making steady progress toward the <br/></p>
        <p>gate. <br/>&quot;Officer Starling.&quot; A new note in Lecter's voice. <br/>She stopped. <i>What in God's
          name do I want this bad? </i>Miggs hissed something <br/></p>
        <p>she didn't listen to. <br/>She stood again in front of Letter's cell and saw the rare spectacle of the doctor
          <br/></p>
        <p>agitated. She knew that he could smell it on her. He could smell everything. <br/>&quot;I would not have had
          that happen to you. Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to <br/></p>
        <p>me.&quot; <br/>It was as though committing murders had purged him of lesser rudeness. Or <br/></p>
        <p>perhaps, Starling thought, it excited him to see her marked in this particular way. She <br/>couldn't tell.
          The sparks in his eyes flew into his darkness like fireflies down a cave. <br/></p>
        <p><i>Whatever it is, use it, Jesus!</i> She held up her briefcase. &quot;Please do this for me.&quot; <br/>Maybe
          she was too late; he was calm again. <br/>&quot;No. But I'll make you happy that you came. I'll give you
          something else. I'll give <br/></p>
        <p>you what you love the most, Clarice Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;What's that, Dr. Lecter?&quot; <br/>&quot;Advancement,
          of course. It works out perfectly--- I'm so glad. Valentine's Day <br/></p>
        <p>made me a think of it.&quot; The smile over white teeth could have come for any reason. He <br/>spoke so
          softly she could barely hear. &quot;Look in Raspail's car for your Valentines. Did you </p>

        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 4 <br/> <br/>C</b>larice Starling was excited, depleted, running on her will. Some of
          the things <br/></p>
        <p>Lecter had said about her were true, and some only clanged on the truth. For a few <br/>seconds she had felt
          an alien consciousness loose in her head, slapping things off the <br/>shelves like a bear in a camper. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>She hated what he'd said about her mother and she had to get rid of the anger. <br/>This was business. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>She sat in her old Pinto across the street from the hospital and breathed deeply. <br/>When the windows
          fogged she had a little privacy from the sidewalk. <br/></p>
        <p><i>Raspail</i>. She remembered the name. He was a patient of Lecter's and one of his <br/>victims. She'd had
          only one evening with the Lecter background material. The file was <br/>vast and Raspail one of many victims.
          She needed to read the details. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling wanted to run with it, but she knew that the urgency was of her own <br/>manufacture. The Raspail
          case was closed years ago. No one was in danger. She had <br/>time. Better to be well informed and well
          advised before she went further. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford might take it away from her and give it to someone else. She'd have to <br/>take that chance. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>She tried to call him from a phone booth, but found he was budget-begging for the <br/>Justice Department
          before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations. <br/></p>
        <p>She could have gotten details of the case from the Baltimore Police Department's <br/>homicide division, but
          murder is not a federal crime and she knew they'd snatch it away <br/>from her immediately, no question. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>She drove back to Quantico, back to Behavioral Science with its homey brown-<br/>checked curtains and its
          gray files full of hell. She sat there into the evening, after the last <br/>secretary had left, cranking
          through the Lecter microfilm. The contrary old viewer <br/>glowed like a Jack-o'-lantern in the darkened room,
          the words and the negatives of <br/>pictures swarming across her intent face. <br/></p>
        <p>Raspail, Benjamin Ren&#233;, WM, 46, was first flutist for the Baltimore Philharmonic <br/>Orchestra. He was
          a patient in Dr. Hannibal Lecter's psychiatric practice. <br/></p>
        <p>On, March 22, 1975, he failed to appear for a performance in Baltimore. On <br/>March 25 his body was
          discovered seated in a pew in a small rural church near Falls <br/>Church, Virginia, dressed only in a white
          tie and a tail coat. Autopsy revealed that <br/>Raspail's heart was pierced and that he was short his thymus
          and pancreas. <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice Starling, who from early life had known much more than she wished to <br/>know about meat processing,
          recognized the missing organs as the sweet-breads. <br/></p>
        <p>Baltimore Homicide believed that these items appeared on the menu of a dinner <br/>Lecter gave for the
          president and the conductor of the Baltimore Philharmonic on the <br/>evening following Raspail's
          disappearance. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Hannibal Lecter professed to know nothing about these matters. The president <br/>and the conductor of
          the Philharmonic testified that they could not recall the fare at Dr. <br/>Lecter's dinner, though Lecter was
          known for the excellence of his table and had contrib-</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>uted numerous articles to gourmet magazines. <br/>The president of the Philharmonic subsequently was
        treated for anorexia and <br/></p>
        <p>problems related to alcohol dependency at a holistic nerve sanitarium in Basel. <br/>Raspail was Lecter's
          ninth known victim, according to the Baltimore police. <br/>Raspail died intestate, and the lawsuits among his
          relatives over the estate were <br/></p>
        <p>followed by the newspapers for a number of months before public interest flagged. <br/>Raspail's relatives
          had also joined with the families of other victims in Lecter s <br/></p>
        <p>practice in a successful lawsuit to have the errant psychiatrist's case files and tapes <br/>destroyed. There
          was no telling what embarrassing secrets he might blab, their reasoning <br/>went, and the files were
          documentation. <br/></p>
        <p>The court had appointed Raspail's lawyer, Everett Yow, to be executor of his <br/>estate. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling would have to apply to the lawyer to get at the car. The lawyer might be <br/>protective of
          Raspail's memory and, with enough advance notice, might destroy evidence <br/>to cover for his late client.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Starling preferred to pounce, and she needed advice and authorization. She was <br/>alone in Behavioral
          Science and had the run of the place. She found Crawford's home <br/>number in the Rolodex. <br/></p>
        <p>She never heard the telephone ringing, but suddenly his voice was there, very <br/>quiet and even. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Jack Crawford.&quot; <br/>&quot;This is Clarice Starling. I hope you weren't eating dinner....&quot;
          She had to continue <br/></p>
        <p>into silence. &quot;...Lecter told me something about the Raspail case today, I'm in the office <br/>following
          it up. He tells me there's something in Raspail's car. I'd have to get at it through <br/>his lawyer, and
          since tomorrow's Saturday--- no school--- I wanted to ask you if---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Starling, do you have any recollection of what I told you to do with the Lecter <br/>information?&quot;
          Crawford's voice was so terribly quiet. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Give you a report by 0900 Sunday.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes
          sir.&quot; <br/>The dial tone stung in her ear. The sting spread over face and made her eyes burn. <br/>&quot;Well
          God fucking shit,&quot; she said. &quot;You old creep. Creepo son of a bitch. Let <br/></p>
        <p>Miggs squirt <i>you </i>and see how you like it.&quot; <br/> <br/></p>
        <p>---------- <br/> <br/></p>
        <p>Starling, scrubbed shiny and wearing her FBI Academy nightgown, was working <br/>on the second draft of her
          report when her dormitory roommate, Ardelia Mapp, came in <br/>from the library. Mapp's broad, brown,
          eminently sane countenance was one of the more <br/>welcome sights of her day. <br/></p>
        <p>Ardelia Mapp saw the fatigue in her face. <br/>&quot;What did you do today, girl?&quot; Mapp always asked
          question as if the answers <br/></p>
        <p>could make no possible difference. <br/>&quot;Wheedled a crazy man with come all over me.&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          wish <i>I </i>had time for a social life--- I don't know how you manage it, and school <br/></p>
        <p>too.&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Starling found that she was laughing. Ardelia Mapp laughed with her, as much as <br/>the small joke was
        worth. Starling did not stop, and she heard herself from far away, <br/>laughing and laughing. Through
        Starling's tears, Mapp looked strangely old and her smile <br/>had sadness in it. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 5 <br/> <br/>J</b>ark Crawford, fifty-three, reads in a wing chair by a low lamp in the
          bedroom of <br/></p>
        <p>his home. He faces two double beds, both raised on blocks to hospital height. One is his <br/>own; in the
          other lies his wife, Bella. Crawford can hear her breathing through her mouth. <br/>It has been two days since
          she last could stir or speak to him. <br/></p>
        <p>She misses a breath. Crawford looks up from his book, over his half-glasses. He <br/>puts the book down.
          Bella breathes again, a flutter and then a full breath. He rises to put <br/>his hand on her, to take her
          blood pressure and her pulse. Over the months he has become <br/>expert with the blood pressure cuff. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Because he will not leave her at night, he has installed a bed for himself beside <br/>her. Because he
          reaches out to her in the dark, his bed is high, like hers. <br/></p>
        <p>Except for the height of the beds and the minimal plumbing necessary for Bella's <br/>comfort, Crawford has
          managed to keep this from looking like a sickroom. There are <br/>flowers, but not too many. No pills are in
          sight--- Crawford emptied a linen closet in the <br/>hall and filled it with her medicines and apparatus
          before he brought her from the <br/>hospital. (It was the second time he had carried her across the threshold
          of that house and <br/>the thought nearly unmanned him.) <br/></p>
        <p>A warm front has come up from the south. The windows are open and the <br/>Virginia air is soft and fresh.
          Small frogs peep to one another in the dark. <br/></p>
        <p>The room is spotless, but the carpet has begun to begun to nap--- Crawford will <br/>not run the noisy vacuum
          cleaner in the room and uses a manual carpet sweeper that is <br/>not as good. He pads to the closet and turns
          on the light. Two clipboards hang on the <br/>inside of the door. On one he notes Bella's pulse and blood
          pressure. His figures and <br/>those of the day nurse alternate in a column that stretches over many yellow
          pages, many <br/>days and nights. On the other clipboard, the day-shift nurse has signed off Bella's <br/>medication.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford is capable of giving any medication she may need in the night. <br/>Following a nurse's directions,
          he practiced injections on a lemon and then on his thighs <br/>before he brought her home. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford stands over her for perhaps three minutes, looking down into her face. <br/>A lovely scarf of silk
          moir&#233; covers her hair like a turban. She insisted on it, for as long as <br/>she could insist. Now he
          insists on it. He moistens her lips with glycerine and removes a <br/>speck from the corner of her eye with
          his broad thumb. She does not stir. It is not yet time <br/>to turn her. <br/></p>
        <p>At the mirror, Crawford assures himself that he is not sick, that he doesn't have to <br/>go into the ground
          with her, that he himself is well. He catches himself doing this and it <br/>shames him. <br/></p>
        <p>Back at his chair he cannot remember what he was reading. He feels the books <br/>beside him to find the one
          that is warm. </p>

      <div><p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 6 <br/> <br/>O</b>n Monday morning, Clarice Starling found this message from
        Crawford in her <br/></p>
        <p>mailbox: <br/> <br/></p>
        <p>CS: <br/> <br/>Proceed on the Raspail car. On <br/></p>
        <p>your own time. My office will provide <br/>you a credit card number for long <br/>distance calls. Ck with me
          before you <br/>contact estate or go anywhere. Report <br/>Wednesday 1600 hours. <br/></p>
        <p><br/>The Director got your Lecter <br/></p>
        <p>report over your signature. You did well. <br/> <br/> JC <br/> SAIC/<br/></p>
        <p>Section 8 <br/> <br/>Starling felt pretty good. She knew Crawford was just giving her an exhausted <br/></p>
        <p>mouse to bat around for practice. But he wanted to teach her. He wanted her to do well. <br/>For Starling,
          that beat courtesy every time. <br/></p>
        <p>Raspail had been dead far eight years. What evience could have lasted in a car <br/>that long? <br/></p>
        <p>She knew from family experience that, because automobiles depreciate so rapidly, <br/>an appellate court will
          let survivors sell a car before probate, the money going into <br/>escrow. It seemed unlikely that even an
          estate as tangled and disputed as Raspail's would <br/>hold a car this long. <br/></p>
        <p>There was also the problem of time. Counting her lunch break, Starling had an <br/>hour and fifteen minutes a
          day free to use the telephone during business hours. She'd <br/>have to report to Crawford on Wednesday
          afternoon. So she had a total of three hours and <br/>forty-five minutes to trace the car, spread over three
          days, if she used her study periods <br/>and made up the study at night. <br/></p>
        <p>She had good notes from her Investigative Procedures Classes, and she'd have a <br/>chance to ask general
          questions of her instructors. <br/></p>
        <p>During her Monday lunch, personnel at the Baltimore County Courthouse put <br/>Starling on hold and forgot
          her three times. During her study period she reached a <br/>friendly clerk at the courthouse, who pulled the
          probate records on the Raspail estate. <br/></p>
        <p>The clerk confirmed that permission had been granted for sale of an auto and gave <br/>Starling the make and
          serial number of the car, and the name of a subsequent off the title <br/>transfer. <br/></p>
        <p>On Tuesday, she wasted half her lunch hour trying to chase down that name. It </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>cost her the rest of her lunch period to find out that the Maryland Department of Motor <br/>Vehicles is
        not equipped to trace a vehicle by serial number, only by registration number <br/>or current tag number. <br/>
      </p>
        <p>On Tuesday afternoon, a downpour drove the trainees in from the firing range. In <br/>a conference room
          steamy with damp clothing and sweat, John Brigham, the ex-Marine <br/>firearms instructor, chose to test
          Starling's hand strength in front of the class by seeing <br/>how many times she could pull the trigger on a
          Model 19 Smith &amp; Wesson in sixty <br/>seconds. <br/></p>
        <p>She managed seventy-four with her left hand, puffed a strand of hair out of her <br/>eyes, and started over
          with her right while another student counted. She was in the <br/>Weaver stance, well braced, the front sight
          in sharp focus, the rear sight and her <br/>makeshift target properly blurred. Midway through her minute, she
          let her mind wander <br/>to get it off the pain. The target on the wall came into focus. It was a certificate
          of <br/>appreciation from the Interstate Commerce enforcement division made out to her <br/>instructor, John
          Brigham. <br/></p>
        <p>She questioned Brigham out of the side of her mouth while the other student <br/>counted the clicks of the
          revolver. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How do you trace the current registration...&quot; <br/><i>&quot;...sixtyfivesixtysixsixtysevensixtyeightsixty...&quot;
          <br/></i>&quot;...of a car when you've only got the serial number...&quot; <br/><i>&quot;seventyeightseventynineeightyeightyone...&quot;
          <br/></i>&quot;...and the make? You don't have a current tag number.&quot; <br/><i>&quot;...eightynine ninety.
          Time.&quot; <br/></i>&quot;All right, you people,&quot; the instructor said, &quot;I want you to take note of
          that. Hand <br/></p>
        <p>strength's a major factor in steady combat shooting. Some of you gentlemen are worried <br/>I'll call on you
          next. Your worries would be justified-Starling is well above average with <br/>both hands. That's because she
          works at it. She works at it with the little squeezy things <br/>you all have access to. Most of you are not
          used to squeezing anything harder than your&quot; <br/>---ever vigilant against his native Marine terminology,
          he groped for a polite simile--- <br/>&quot;zits,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Get serious, Starling, you're
          not good enough either. I want to see <br/>that left hand over ninety before you graduate. Pair up and time
          each other--- chop-chop. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Not you, Starling, come here. What else have you got on the car?&quot; <br/>&quot;Just the serial
          number and make, that's it. One prior owner five years ago.&quot; <br/>&quot;All right, listen. Where most
          people f--- fall into error is trying to leapfrog <br/></p>
        <p>through the registrations from one owner to the next. You get fouled up between states. I <br/>mean, cops
          even do that sometimes. And registrations and tag numbers are all the <br/>computer's got. We're all
          accustomed to using tag numbers or registration numbers, not <br/>vehicle serial numbers.&quot; <br/></p>

        <p>&quot;There's one way it's easy. R. L. Polk and Company, that publishes city <br/>directories--- they also
          put out a list current car registrations by make and consecutive <br/>serial number. It's the only place. Car
          dealers steer then advertising with them. How'd you <br/>know to ask me?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You were ICC enforcement, I figured you'd traced a lot of vehicles. Thanks.&quot; <br/>&quot;Pay me

        notes <br/></p>
        <p>were barely legible. Raspail's car was a Ford. There was a Ford dealer near the <br/>University of Virginia
          who for years had patiently done what he could with her Pinto. <br/>Now, just as patiendy, the dealer poked
          through his Polk listings for her. He came back to <br/>the telephone with the name and address of the person
          who had last registered Benjamin <br/>Raspail's car. <br/></p>

        <p>No answer, and again no answer. The ring sounded funny and far away, a double <br/>rump-rump like a party
          line. She tried at night and got no answer. <br/></p>
        <p>At Wednesday lunch period, a man answered Starling's call: <br/>&quot;WPOQ Plays the Oldies.&quot; <br/>&quot;Hello,
          I'm calling to---&quot; <br/>&quot;I wouldn't care for any aluminum siding and I don't want to live in no

        <p>court in Florida, what else you got?&quot; <br/>Starling heard a lot of the Arkansas hills in the man's
          voice. She could speak that <br/></p>
        <p>with anybody when she wanted to, and her time was short. <br/>&quot;Yessir, if you could help me out I'd be

        <p>Mr. Lomax Bardwell? This is Clarice Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's Starling somebody,&quot; the man yelled
          to the rest of his household. &quot;What do <br/></p>

          He's entitled to <br/></p>

        <p>into a cube to be recycled. The foreman read Starling the vehicle serial number from his <br/>records. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Shit House Mouse, thought Starling, not entirely out of the accent. Dead end. <br/>Some Valentine. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling rested her head against the cold coin box in the telephone booth. Ardelia <br/>Mapp, her books on
          her hip, pecked on the door of the booth and handed in an Orange <br/>Crush. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Much oblige, Ardelia. I got to make one more call. If I can get done with that in <br/>time, I'll catch
          up with you in the cafeteria, okay?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I was <i>so </i>in hopes you'd overcome that ghastly dialect,&quot; Mapp said. &quot;Books are <br/>available
          to help you. <i>I </i>never use the colorful patois of my housing project anymore. You <br/>come talking that
          mushmouth, people say you eat up with the dumb-ass, girl.&quot; Mapp <br/>closed the phone booth door. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Starling felt she had to try for more information from Lecter. If she already had <br/>the appointment, maybe
          Crawford would let her return to the asylum. She dialed Dr. <br/>Chilton's number, but she never got past his
          secretary. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Chilton is with the coroner and the assistant district attorney,&quot; the woman <br/>said. &quot;He's
          already spoken to your supervisor and he has nothing to say to you. Good-<br/>bye.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 7 <br/> <br/>&quot;Y</b>our friend Miggs is dead,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;Did you
          tell me everything, <br/></p>
        <p>Starling?&quot; Crawford's tired face was as sensitive to signals as the dished ruff of an owl, <br/>and as
          free of mercy. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How?&quot; She felt numb and she had to handle it. <br/>&quot;Swallowed his tongue sometime before
          daylight. Letter suggested it to him, <br/></p>
        <p>Chilton thinks. The overnight orderly -heard Lecter talking softly to Miggs. Lecter knew <br/>a lot about
          Miggs. He talked to him for a little while, but the overnight couldn't hear what <br/>Lecter said. Miggs was
          crying for a while, and then he stopped. Did you tell me <br/>everything, Starling?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes sir. Between the report and my memo, there's everything, almost verbatim.&quot; <br/>&quot;Chilton
          called up to complain about you...&quot; Crawford waited, and seemed <br/></p>
        <p>pleased when she wouldn't ask. &quot;I told him I found your behavior satisfactory. Chilton's <br/>trying to
          forestall a civil rights investigation.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Will there be one?&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure, if Miggs' family wants it. Civil Rights Division will do
          probably eight <br/></p>
        <p>thousand this year. They'll be glad to add Miggs to the list.&quot; Crawford studied her. &quot;You <br/>okay?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I don't know how to feel about it.&quot; <br/>&quot;You don't have to feel any particular way about it.
          Lecter did it to amuse himself. <br/></p>
        <p>He knows they can't really touch him for it, so why not? Chilton takes his books and his <br/>toilet seat for
          a while is all, and he doesn't get any Jell-O.&quot; Crawford laced his fingers </p>

        <p>that's why he talked to me.&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't know anything personal about you,

        <p>you've got a problem believing that, let's get it straight now.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm satisfied. Next item.
          &quot; <br/>&quot;You thought <i>something</i>, or---&quot; <br/>&quot;Proceed to the next item, Starling.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Lecter s hint about Raspail's car is a dead end. It was mashed into a cube four <br/></p>
        <p>months ago in Number Nine Ditch, Arkansas, and sold for recycling. Maybe if I go back <br/>in and talk to
          him, he'll tell me more.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You've exhausted the lead?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Why do you think the car Raspail
          drove was his only car?&quot; <br/>&quot;It was the only one registered, he was single, I assumed---&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Aha, hold it.&quot; Crawford's forefinger pointed to some principle invisible in the air <br/></p>
        <p>between them. &quot;You assumed. You <i>assumed</i>, Starling. Look here.&quot; Crawford wrote <br/>assume on
          a legal pad. Several of Starling's instnictors had picked this up from Crawford <br/>and used it, but Starling
          didn't reveal that she'd seen it before. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford began to underline: &quot;If you <i>assume </i>when I send you on a job, Starling, <br/>you can make
          an <i>ass </i>out of <i>u </i>and <i>me </i>both.&quot; He leaned back, pleased: &quot;Raspail collected <br/>cars,
          did you know that?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, does the estate still have them?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't know. Do you think you could manage to
          find out?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, I can.&quot; <br/>&quot;Where would you start?&quot; <br/>&quot;His executor.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;A lawyer in Baltimore, a Chinese, I seem to remember,&quot; Crawford said. <br/>&quot;Everett Yow,&quot;
          Starling said: &quot;He's in the Baltimore phone book.&quot; <br/>&quot;Have you given any thought to the
          question of a warrant to search Raspail's car?&quot; <br/>Sometimes Crawford's tone reminded Starling of the
          know-it-all caterpillar in <br/></p>
        <p>Lewis Carroll. <br/>Starling didn't dare give it back, much. &quot;Since Raspail is deceased and riot <br/>
        </p>
        <p>suspected of anything, if we have permission of his executor to search the car, then it is a <br/>valid
          search, and the fruit admissible evidence in other matters at law,&quot; she recited. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Precisely,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;Tell you what: I'll advise the Baltimore field office <br/>you'll
          be up there. Saturday, Starling, on your own time. Go feel the fruit, if there is any.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford made a small, successful effort not to look after her as she left. From his <br/>wastebasket he
          lifted in the fork of his fingers a wad of heavy mauve notegaper. He <br/>spread it on his desk. It was about
          his wife and it said, in an engaging hand: </p>

        <br/>Hannibal Lecter <br/></p>
        <p><br/> <br/></p>
        <p><b> <br/>CHAPTER 8 <br/> <br/>E</b>verett Yow drove a black Buick with a De Paul University sticker on the
          back <br/></p>
        <p>window. His weight gave the Buick a slight list to the left as Clarice Starling followed <br/>him out of
          Baltimore in the rain. It was almost dark; Starling's day as an investigator was <br/>nearly gone and she
          didn't have another day to replace it. She dealt with her impatience, <br/>tapping the wheel in time with the
          wipers as the traffic crawled down Route 301. <br/></p>
        <p>Yow was intelligent, fat, and had a breathing problem. Starling guessed his age at <br/>sixty. So far he was
          accommodating. The lost day was not his fault; returning in the late <br/>afternoon from a week-long business
          trip to Chicago, the Baltimore lawyer had come <br/>directly from the airport to his office to meet Starling.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Raspail's classic Packard had been stored since long before his death, Yow <br/>explained. It was unlicensed
          and never driven. Yow had seen it once, covered and in <br/>storage, to confirm its existence for the estate
          inventory he made shortly after his client's <br/>murder. If Investigator Starling would agree to &quot;frankly
          disclose at once&quot; anything she <br/>found that might be damaging to his late client's interests, he would
          show her the <br/>automobile, he said. A warrant and the attendant stir would not be necessary. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling was enjoying the use for one day of an FBI motor pool Plymouth with a <br/>cellular telephone, and
          she had a new ID card provided by Crawford. It simply said <br/>FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR --- and expired in a
          week, she noticed. <br/></p>
        <p>Their destination was Split City Mini-Storage, about four miles past the city <br/>limits. Creeping along
          with the traffic, Starling used her telephone to find out what she <br/>could about the storage facility. By
          the time she spotted the high orange sign, SLIT CITY <br/>MINI-STORAGE --- YOU KEEP THE KEY, she had learned a
          few facts. <br/></p>
        <p>Split City had an Interstate Commerce Commission freight-forwarder's license, in <br/>the name of Bernard
          Gary. A federal grand jury had barely missed Gary for interstate <br/>transportation of stolen goods three
          years ago, and his license was up for review. <br/></p>
        <p>Yow turned in beneath the sign and showed his keys to a spotty young man in <br/>uniform at the gate. The
          gatekeeper logged their license numbers, opened up and <br/>beckoned impatiently, as though he had more
          important things to do. <br/></p>
        <p>Split City is a bleak place the wind blows through. Like the Sunday divorce flight <br/>from La Guardia to Ju&#225;rez,
          it is a service industry to the mindless Brownian movement in <br/>our population; most of its business is
          storing the sundered chattels of divorce. Its units <br/>are stacked with living room suites, breakfast
          ensembles, spotted mattresses, toys, and the </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>photographs of things that didn't work out. It is widely believed among Baltimore County <br/>sheriff's
        officers that Split City also hides good and valuable consideration from the <br/>bankruptcy courts. <br/></p>
        <p>It resembles a military installation: thirty acres of long buildings divided by fire <br/>walls into units
          the size of a generous single garage, each with its roll-up overhead door. <br/>The rates are reasonable and
          some of the property has been there for years. Security is <br/>good. The place is surrounded by a double row
          of high hurricane fence, and dogs patrol <br/>between the fences twenty-four hours a day. <br/></p>
        <p>Six inches of sodden leaves, mixed with paper cups and small trash, had banked <br/>against the bottom of the
          of Raspail's storage unit, number 31. A hefty padlock secured <br/>each side of the door. The left-side hasp
          also had a seal on it. Everett Yow bent stiffly <br/>over the seal. Starling held the umbrella and a
          flashlight in the early dark. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;It doesn't appear to have been opened since I was five years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;You <br/>see the
          impression my notary seal here in the plastic. I had no idea at the time that the <br/>relatives would be so
          contentious and would drag out the probate for so many years.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Yow held the flashlight and umbrella while Starling took a picture of the lock and <br/>seal. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Mr. Raspail had an office-studio in the city, which I closed down to save the <br/>estate from paying
          rent,&quot; he said. &quot;I had the furnishings brought here and stored them <br/>with Raspail's car and
          other things that were already here. We brought an upright piano, <br/>books and music, a bed, I think.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Yow tried a key. &quot;The locks may be frozen. At least this one's very stiff.&quot; It was <br/>hard for
          him to bend over and breathe at the same time. When he tried to squat, his knees <br/>creaked. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling was glad to see that the padlocks were big chrome American Standards. <br/>They looked formidable,
          but she knew she could pop the brass cylinders out easily with a <br/>sheet metal screw and a claw hammer---
          her father had showed her how burglars do it <br/>when she was a child. The problem would be finding the
          hammer and screw; she did not <br/>even have the benefit of the resident junk in her Pinto. <br/></p>
        <p>She poked through her purse and found the de-icer spray she used on her Pinto's <br/>door locks. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Want to rest a second in your car, Mr. Yow? Why don't you warm up for a few <br/>minutes and I'll give
          this a try. Take the umbrella, it's only a drizzle now.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling moved the FBI Plymouth up close to the door to use its headlights. She <br/>pulled the dipstick out
          of the car and dripped oil into the keyholes of the padlocks, then <br/>sprayed in de-icer to thin the oil.
          Mr. Yow smiled and nodded from his car. Starling was <br/>glad Yow was an intelligent man; she could perform
          her task without alienating him. <br/></p>
        <p>It was dark now. She felt exposed in the glare of the Plymouth's headlights and <br/>the fan belt squealed in
          her ear as the car idled. She'd locked the car while it was running. <br/>Mr. Yow appeared to be harmless, but
          she saw no reason to take a chance on being <br/>mashed against the door. <br/></p>
        <p>The padlock jumped like a frog in her hand and lay there open, heavy and greasy. <br/>The other lock, having
          soaked, was easier. <br/></p>
        <p>The door would not come up. Starling lifted on the handle until bright spots <br/>danced before her eyes. Yow
          came to help, but between the small, inadequate door <br/>handle and his hernia, they exerted little
          additional force. </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;We might return next week, with my son, or with some workmen,&quot; Mr. Yow <br/>suggested. &quot;I
        would like very much to go home soon.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling was not at all sure she'd ever get back to this place; it would be less <br/>trouble to Crawford if
          he just picked up the telephone and had the Baltimore field office <br/>handle it. &quot;Mr. Yow, I'll hurry.
          Do you have a bumper jack in this car?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>With the jack under the handle of the door, Starling used her weight on top of the <br/>lug wrench that
          served as a jack handle. The door squealed horribly and went up a half-<br/>inch. It appeared to be bending
          upward in the center. The door went up another inch and <br/>another until she could slide the spark tire
          under it, to hold it up while she moved Mr. <br/>Yow's jack and her own to the sides of the door, placing them
          under the bottom edge, <br/>close to the tracks the door ran in. <br/></p>
        <p>Alternating at the jacks on each side, she inched the door up a foot and a half, <br/>where it jammed solidly
          and her full weight on the jack handles would not raise it. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Yow came to peer under the door with her. He could only bend over for a few <br/>seconds at a time. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;It smells like mice in there,&quot; he said. &quot;I was assured they used rodent poison <br/>here. I
          believe it is specified in contract. Rodents are almost unknown, they said. but I <br/>hear them, do you?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I hear them,&quot; Starling said. With her flashlight, she could pick out cardboard <br/>boxes and one
          big tire with wide whitewall beneath the edge of a cloth cover. The tire <br/>was flat. <br/></p>
        <p>She backed the Plymouth up until part of the headlight pattern shone under the <br/>door, and she took out
          one of the rubber floor mats. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You're going in there, Officer Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;I have to take a look, Mr. Yow.&quot; <br/>He
          took out his handkerchief. &quot;May I suggest you tie your cuffs snugly around <br/></p>
        <p>your ankles? To prevent mouse intrusion.&quot; <br/>&quot;Thank you, sir, that's a very good idea. Mr. Yow,
          if the door should come down, <br/></p>
        <p>ha ha, or something else should occur, would you be kind enough to call this number? It's <br/>our Baltimore
          field office. They know I'm here with you right now, and they'll be alarmed <br/>if they don't hear from me in
          a little while, do you follow me?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, of course. Absolutely, I do.&quot; He gave her the key to the Packard. <br/>Starling put the
          rubber. mat on the, wet ground in front of the door and lay down <br/></p>
        <p>on it, her hand cupping a pack of plastic evidence bags over the lens of her camera and <br/>her cuffs tied
          snugly with Yow s handkerchief and her own. A mist of rain fell in her <br/>face, and the smell of mold and
          mice was strong in her nose. What occurred to Starling <br/>was, absurdly, Latin. <br/></p>
        <p>Written on the blackboard by her forensics instructor on her first day in training, it <br/>was the motto of
          the Roman physician: <i>Primum non nocere.</i> First do no harm. <br/></p>
        <p><i>He didn't say that in a garage full of fucking mice. <br/></i>And suddenly her father's voice, speaking to
          her with his hand on her brother's <br/></p>
        <p>shoulder, &quot;If you can't play without squawling, Clarice, go on to the house.&quot; <br/>Starling
          fastened the collar button of her blouse, scrunched her shoulders up <br/></p>
        <p>around her neck and slid under the door. <br/>She was beneath the rear of the Packard. It was parked close to
          the left side of the <br/></p>
        <p>storage room, almost touching the wall. Cardboard boxes were stacked high on the right </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>side of the room, filling the space beside the car. Starling wriggled along on her back <br/>until her
        head was out in the narrow gap left between the car and the boxes. She shined <br/>her flashlight up the cliff
        face of boxes. Many spiders had spanned the narrow space with <br/>their webs. Orb weavers, mostly, the webs
        dotted with small shriveled carcasses tightly <br/>bound. <br/></p>
        <p><i>Well, a brown recluse spider is the only kind to worry about, and it wouldn't build <br/>out in the open,</i>
          Starling said to herself. <i>The rest don't raise much of a welt. <br/></i></p>
        <p>There would be space to stand beside the rear fender. She wriggled around until <br/>she was out from under
          the car, her face close beside the wide whitewall tire. It was <br/>hatched with dry rot. She could read the
          words GOODYEAR DOUBLE EAGLE on it. <br/>Careful of her head, she got to her feet in the narrow space, hand
          before her face to break <br/>the webs. Was this how it felt to wear a veil? <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Yow's voice from outside. &quot;Okay, Miss Starling?&#8222; <br/>&quot;Okay,&quot; she said. There were
          small scurryings at the sound of her voice, and, <br/></p>
        <p>something inside a piano climbed over a few high notes. The car lights from outside lit <br/>her legs up to
          the calf. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So you found the piano, Officer Starling,&quot; Mr. Yow called.<b> <br/></b>&quot;That wasn't me.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Oh.&quot; <br/>The car was big, tall and long. A 1938 Packard limousine, according to Yow's <br/>
        </p>
        <p>inventory. It was covered with a rug, the plush side down. She played her flashlight over <br/>it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did you cover the car with this rug, Mr. Yow?&quot; <br/>&quot;I found it that way and I never
          uncovered it,&quot; Yow called under the door. &quot;I can't <br/></p>
        <p>deal with a dusty rug. That's the way Raspail had it. I just made sure the car vas there. My <br/>movers put
          the piano against the wall and covered it and stacked more boxes beside the <br/>car and left. I was paying
          them by the hour. The boxes are sheet music and books, <br/>mostly.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The rug was thick and heavy and as she tugged at it, dust swarmed in the beam of <br/>her flashlight. She
          sneezed twice. Standing on tiptoe, she could fold the rug over to the <br/>midline of the tall old car. The
          curtains were drawn in the back windows. The door <br/>handle was covered with dust. She had to lean forward
          over cartons to reach it. Touching <br/>only the end of the handle, she tried to turn it downward. Locked.
          There was no keyhole <br/>in the rear door. She'd have to move a lot of boxes to get to the front door, and
          there was <br/>damn little place to put them. She could see a small gap between the curtain and the post <br/>of
          the rear window. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling leaned over boxes to put her eye close to the glass and shined her light <br/>through the crack. She
          could only see her reflection until she cupped her hand on top of <br/>the light. A splinter of the beam,
          diffused by the dusty glass, moved across the seat. An <br/>album lay open on the seat. The colors were poor
          in the bad light, but she could see <br/>Valentines pasted on the pages. Lacy old Valentines, fluffy on the
          page. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Thanks a lot, Dr. Lecter.&quot; When she spoke, her breath stirred the fuzz of dust on <br/>the
          windowsill and fogged the glass. She didn't want to wipe it, so she had to wait for it to <br/>clear. The
          light moved on, over a lap rug crumpled on the floor of the car and onto the <br/>dusty wink of a pair of
          man's patent leather evening shoes. Above the shoes, black socks <br/>and above the socks were tuxedo trousers
          with legs in them. </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p><i>Nobody'sbeeninthatdoorinfiveyears--- easy, easy, hold it baby. <br/></i>&quot;Oh, Mr. Yow. Say, Mr.
        Yow?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, Officer Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Mr. Yow, looks like somebody's sitting in this
        car.&quot; <br/>&quot;Oh my. Maybe you better come out, Miss Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;Not quite yet, Mr. Yow.
        Just wait there, if you will, please.&quot; <br/><i>Now is when it's important to think. Now is more important

        <p><i>tell your pillow for the rest of your life. Suck it up and do this right. I don't want to <br/>destroy
          evidence. I do want some help. But most of all I don't want to cry wolf. If I <br/>scramble the Baltimore
          office and the cops out here for nothing, I've had it. I see what <br/>looks like some legs. Mr. Yow would not
          have brought me here </i>if <i>he'd known there was a <br/>cool one in the car. </i>She managed to smile at
          herself. &quot;Cool one&quot; was bravado. <i>Nobody's <br/>been here since Yow's last visit. All right, that
            means the boxes were put here after <br/>whatever's in the car. And that means I can move the boxes without
            losing anything <br/>important. <br/></i></p>
        <p>&quot;All right, Mr. Yow.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes. Do we have to call the police, or are you sufficient, Officer
          Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;I've got to find that out. Just wait right there, please.&quot; <br/>The box
          problem was as maddening as Rubik's Cube. She tried to work with the <br/></p>
        <p>flashlight under her arm, dropped it twice, and finally put it on top of the car. She had to <br/>put boxes
          behind her, and some of the shorter box cartons would slide under the car. <br/>Some kind of bite or splinter
          made the ball of her thumb itch. <br/></p>
        <p>Now she could see through the dusty glass of the front passenger's side window <br/>into the chauffeur's
          compartment. A spider had spun between the big steering wheel and <br/>the gearshift. The partition between
          the front and back compartments was closed. <br/></p>
        <p>She wished she had thought to oil the Packard key before she came under the <br/>door, but when she stuck it
          the lock, it worked. <br/></p>
        <p>There was hardly room to open the door more than a third of the way in the <br/>narrow passage. It swung
          against the boxes with a thump that sent the mice scratching <br/>and brought additional notes from the piano.
          A stale smell of decay and chemical came <br/>out of the car. It jogged her memory in a place she couldn't
          name. <br/></p>
        <p>She leaned inside, opened the partition behind the chauffeur's seat, and shined her <br/>flashlight into the
          rear compartment of the car. A formal shirt with studs was the bright <br/>thing the light found first,
          quickly up the shirtfront to the face, no face to see, and down <br/>again, over glittering shirt studs and
          satin lapels to a lap with zipper open, and up again to <br/>the neat bow tie and the collar, where the white
          stub neck of a mannequin protruded. But <br/>above the neck, something, else that reflected little light.
          Cloth, a black hood where the <br/>head should be, big, as though it covered a parrot's cage. Velvet, Starling
          thought. It sat <br/>on a plywood shelf extending over the neck of the mannequin from the parcel shelf <br/>behind.
          <br/></p>
        <p>She took several pictures from the front seat, focusing with the flashlight and <br/>closing her eyes against
          the flash of the strobe. Then she straightened up outside the car. <br/>Standing in the dark, wet, with
          cobwebs on her, she considered what to do. <br/></p>
        <p>What she was <i>not </i>going to do was summon the special agent in charge of the <br/>Baltimore field office
          to look at a mannequin with its fly open and a book of Valentines. <br/></p>
        <p>Once she decided to get in the backseat and take the hood off the thing, she didn't </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>want to think about it very long. She reached through the chauffeur's partition, unlocked <br/>the rear
        door, and rearranged some boxes to get it open. It all seemed to take a long time. <br/>The smell from the rear
        compartment was much stronger when she opened the door. She <br/>reached in and, carefully lifting the Valentine
        album by the corners, moved it onto an <br/>evidence bag on top of the car. She spread another evidence bag on
        the seat. <br/></p>
        <p>The car springs groaned as she got inside and the figure shifted a little when she <br/>sat down beside it.
          The right hand in its white glove slid off the thigh and lay on the seat. <br/>She touched the glove with her
          finger. The hand inside was hard. Gingerly she pushed the <br/>glove down from the wrist. The wrist was some
          white synthetic material. There was a <br/>lump in the trousers that for a silly instant reminded her of
          certain events in high school. <br/></p>
        <p>Small scrambling noises came from under the seat. <br/>Gentle as a caress, her hand touching the hood. The
          cloth moved easily over <br/></p>
        <p>something hard and slick beneath. When she felt the round knob on the top, she knew. <br/>She knew that it
          was a big laboratory specimen jar and she knew what would be in it. <br/>With dread, but little doubt, she
          pulled off the cover. <br/></p>
        <p>The head inside the jar had been severed neatly close beneath the jaw. It faced <br/>her, the eyes long
          burned milky by the alcohol that preserved it. The mouth was open and <br/>the tongue protruded slightly, very
          gray. Over the years, the alcohol had evaporated to the <br/>point that the head rested on the bottom of the
          jar, its crown protruding through the <br/>surface of the fluid in a cap of decay. Turned at an owlish angle
          to the body beneath, it <br/>gaped stupidly at Starling. Even in the play of light over the features, it
          remained dumb <br/>and dead. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling, in this moment, examined herself. She was pleased. She was exhilarated. <br/>She wondered for a
          second if those were worthy feelings. Now, at this moment, sitting in <br/>this old car with a head and some
          mice, she could think clearly, and she was proud of <br/>that. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Well, Toto,&quot; she said, &quot;we're not in Kansas anymore.&quot; She'd always wanted to <br/>say
          that under stress, but doing it left her feeling phony,, and she was glad nobody had <br/>heard. Work to do.
          <br/></p>
        <p>She sat back gingerly and looked around. <br/>This was somebody's environment, chosen and created, a thousand
          light-years <br/></p>
        <p>across the mind from the traffic crawling down Route 301. <br/>Dried blossoms dropped from the cut-crystal
          bud vases on the pillars. The <br/></p>
        <p>limousine's table was folded down and covered with a linen cloth. On it, a decanter <br/>gleamed through
          dust. A spider had built between the decanter and the short candlestick <br/>beside it. <br/></p>
        <p>She tried to picture Lecter, or someone, sitting here with her present companion <br/>and having a drink and
          trying to show him the Valentines. And what else? Working <br/>carefully, disturbing the figure as little as
          possible, she frisked it for identification. There <br/>was none. In a jacket pocket she found the bands of
          material left over from adjusting the <br/>length of the trousers--- the dinner clothes were probably new when
          they were put on the <br/>figure. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling poked the lump in the trousers. Too hard, even for high school, she <br/>reflected. She spread the
          fly with her fingers and shined her light inside, on dildo of <br/>polished, inlaid wood. Good-sized one, too.
          She wondered if she was depraved. <br/></p>
        <p>Carefully she turned the jar and examined the sides and back of the head for </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>wounds. There were none visible. The name of a laboratory supply company was cast in <br/>the glass. <br/>
      </p>
        <p>Considering the face again, she believed she learned something that would last <br/>her. Looking with purpose
          at this face, with its tongue changing color where it touched <br/>the glass, was not as bad as Miggs
          swallowing his tongue in her dreams. She felt she <br/>could look at anything, if she had something positive
          to do about it. Starling was young. <br/></p>
        <p><br/>---------- <br/></p>
        <p><br/>In the ten seconds after her WPIK-TV mobile news unit slid to a stop, Jonetta <br/></p>
        <p>Johnson put in her earrings, powdered her beautiful brown face, and cased the situation. <br/>She and her
          news crew, monitoring the Baltimore County police radio, had arrived at <br/>Split City ahead of the patrol
          cars. <br/></p>
        <p>All the news crew saw in their headlights was Clarice Starling, standing in front <br/>of the garage door
          with her flashlight and her little laminated ID card, her hair plastered <br/>down by the drizzle. <br/></p>
        <p>Jonetta Johnson could spot a rookie every time. She climbed out with the camera <br/>crew behind her and
          approached Starling. The bright lights came on. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Yow sank so far down in his Buick that only his hat was visible above the <br/>window sill. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Jonetta Johnson, WPIK news, did you report a homicide?&quot; <br/>Starling did not look like very much
          law and she knew it. &quot;I'm a federal officer, <br/></p>
        <p>this is a crime scene. I have to secure it until the Baltimore authorities---&quot; <br/>The assistant
          cameraman had grabbed the bottom of the garage door and was <br/></p>
        <p>trying to lift it. <br/>&quot;Hold it,&quot; Starling said. &quot;I'm talking to <i>you</i>, sir. Hold it.
          Back off, please. I'm not <br/></p>
        <p>kidding with you. Help me out here.&quot; She wished hard for a badge, a uniform, anything. <br/>&quot;Okay,
          Harry,&quot; the newswoman said. &quot;Ah, officer, we want to cooperate in every <br/></p>
        <p>way. Frankly, this crew costs money and I just want to know whether to even keep them <br/>here until the
          other authorities arrive. Will you tell me if there's a body in there? Camera's <br/>off, just between us.
          Tell me and we'll wait. We'll be good, I promise. How about it?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'd wait if I were you,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;Thanks, you won't be sorry,&quot; Jonetta
          Johnson said. &quot;Look, I've got some <br/></p>
        <p>information on Split City Mini-Storage that you could probably use. Would you shine <br/>your light on the
          clipboard? Let's see if I can find it here.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;WEYE mobile unit just turned in at the gate, Joney,&quot; the man, Harry, said. <br/>&quot;Let's see if
          I can find it here, Officer, here it is. There was a scandal about two <br/></p>
        <p>years ago when they tried to prove this place was trucking and storing--- was it <br/>fireworks?&quot;
          Jonetta Johnson glanced over Starling's shoulder once too often. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling turned to see the cameraman on his back, his head and shoulders in the <br/>garage, the assistant
          squatting beside him, ready to pass the minicam under the door. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Starling said. She dropped to her knees on the wet ground beside him and <br/>tugged at his
          shirt. &quot;You can't go in there. Hey! I told you not to do that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>And all the time the men were talking to her, constantly, gently. &quot;We won't touch <br/>anything. We're
          pros, you don't have to worry. The cops will let us in anyway. It's all <br/>right, honey.&quot; </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Their cozening backseat manner put her over. <br/>She ran to a bumper jack at the end of the door and
        pumped the handle: The door <br/></p>
        <p>came down two inches, with a grinding screech. She pumped it again. Now the door was <br/>touching the man's
          chest. When he didn't come out, she pulled the handle out of the <br/>socket and carried it back to the prone
          cameraman. There were other bright television <br/>lights now, and in the glare of them she banged the door
          above him hard with the jack <br/>handle, showering dust and rust down on him. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Give me your attention,&quot; she said. &quot;You don't listen, do you? Come out of there. <br/>Now.
          You're one second from arrest for obstruction of justice.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Take it easy,&quot; the assistant said. He put his hand on her. She turned on him. <br/>There were
          shouted questions from behind the glare and she heard sirens. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Hands off and back off, buster.&quot; She stood on the cameraman's ankle and faced <br/>the assistant,
          the jack handle hanging by her side. She did not raise the jack handle. It was <br/>just as well. She looked
          bad enough on television as it was. <br/> <br/></p>
        <p><b> <br/>CHAPTER 9 <br/> <br/>T</b>he odors of the violent ward seemed more intense in the semidarkness. A TV
          set <br/></p>
        <p>playing without sound in the corridor threw Starling's shadow on the bars of Dr. Lecter's <br/>cage. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>She could not see into the dark behind the bars, but she didn't ask the orderly to <br/>turn up the lights
          from his station. The whole ward would light at once and she knew the <br/>Baltimore County police had had the
          lights full on for hours while they shouted questions <br/>at Lecter. He had refused to speak, but responded
          by folding for them an origami chicken <br/>that pecked when the tail was manipulated up and down. The senior
          officer, furious, had <br/>crushed the chicken in the lobby ashtray as he gestured for Starling to go in.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter?&quot; She heard her own breathing, and breathing down the hall, but from <br/>Miggs' empty
          cell, no breathing. Miggs' cell was vastly empty. She felt its silence like a <br/>draft. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling knew Lecter was watching her from the darkness. Two minutes passed. <br/>Her legs and back ached
          from her struggle with the garage door, and her clothes were <br/>damp. She sat on her coat on the floor, well
          back from the bars, her feet tucked under her, <br/>and lifted her wet, bedraggled hair over her collar to get
          it off her neck. <br/></p>
        <p>Behind her on the TV screen, an evangelist waved his arms. <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter, we both know what this is.
          They think you'll talk to me.&quot; <br/>Silence. Down the hall, someone whistled &quot;Over the Sea to Skye.&quot;
          <br/>After five minutes, she said, &quot;It was strange going in there. Sometime I'd like to <br/></p>
        <p>talk to you about it.&quot; <br/>Starling jumped when the food carrier rolled out of Lecter's cell. There was
          a <br/></p>
        <p>clean, folded towel in the tray. She hadn't heard him move. <br/>She looked at it and, with a sense of
          falling, took it and toweled her hair. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?&quot; His voice was close,
          at her level. He <br/></p>
        <p>must be sitting on the floor too. <br/>&quot;Do you know something about him?&quot; </p>

        <p>person in the Packard.&quot; <br/>&quot;You found an entire person? Odd. I only saw a head. Where do you
          suppose the <br/></p>
        <p>rest came from?&quot; <br/>&quot;All right. Whose <i>head </i>was it?&quot; <br/>&quot;What can you tell?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;They've only done the preliminary stuff. White male, about twenty-seven, both <br/></p>
        <p>American and European dentistry. Who was he?&quot; <br/>&quot;Raspail's lover. Raspail, of the gluey flute.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;What were the circumstances--- how did he die?&quot; <br/>&quot;Circumlocution, Officer Starling?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;No, I'll ask it later.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let me save you some time. I didn't do it; Raspail did.
          Raspail liked sailors. This <br/></p>
        <p>was a Scandinavian one named Klaus something. Raspail never told me the last name.&quot; <br/>Dr. Lecter's
          voice moved lower. Maybe he was lying on the floor, Starling <br/></p>
        <p>thought. <br/>&quot;Klaus was off a Swedish boat in San Diego. Raspail was out there teaching for a <br/></p>
        <p>summer at the conservatory. He went berserk over the young man. The Swede saw a <br/>good thing and jumped
          his boat. They bought some kind of awful camper and sylphed <br/>through the woods naked. Raspail said the
          young man was unfaithful and he strangled <br/>him.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Raspail told you this?&quot; <br/>&quot;Oh yes, under the confidential seal of therapy sessions. I
          think it was a lie. <br/></p>
        <p>Raspail always embellished the facts. He wanted to seem dangerous and romantic. The <br/>Swede probably died
          in some banal erotic asphyxia transaction. Raspail was too flabby <br/>and weak to have strangled him. Notice
          how closely Klaus was trimmed under the jaw? <br/>Probably to remove a high ligature mark from hanging.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I see.&quot; <br/>&quot;Raspail's dream of happiness was ruined. He put Klaus' head in a bowling bag
          <br/></p>
        <p>and came back East.&quot; <br/>&quot;What did he do with the rest?&quot; <br/>&quot;Buried it in the hills.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;He showed you the head in the car?&quot; <br/>&quot;Oh yes, in the course of therapy he came to
          feel he could tell me anything. He <br/></p>
        <p>went out to sit with Klaus quite often and showed him the Valentines.&quot; <br/>&quot;And then Raspail
          himself... died. Why?&quot; <br/>&quot;Frankly, I got sick and tired of his whining. Best thing for him,
          really. Therapy <br/></p>
        <p>wasn't going anywhere. I expect most psychiatrists have a patient or two they'd like to <br/>refer to me.
          I've never discussed this before, and now I'm getting bored with it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;And your dinner for the orchestra officials.&quot; </p>

        <p>&quot;Yes. I think I'll just call you-&quot; <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter--- that seems most appropriate to your age
          and station,&quot; he said. <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;How did you feel when you went into the garage?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Apprehensive.&quot; <br/>&quot;Why?&quot; <br/>&quot;Mice and insects.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you have
          something you use when you want to get up your nerve?&quot; Dr. <br/></p>
        <p>Lecter asked. <br/>&quot;Nothing I know of that works, except wanting what I'm after.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do
          memories or tableaux occur to you then, whether you try for them or not?&quot; <br/>&quot;Maybe. I haven't
          thought about it.&quot; <br/>&quot;Things from your early life.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll have to watch and see.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;How did you feel when you heard about my late neighbor, Miggs? You haven't <br/></p>
        <p>asked me about it.&quot; <br/>&quot;I was getting to it.&quot; <br/>&quot;Weren't you <i>glad </i>when you
          heard?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Were you <i>sad?&quot; <br/></i>&quot;No. Did you talk him into
          it?&quot; <br/>Dr. Lecter laughed quietly. &quot;Are you asking me, Officer Starling, if I <i>suborned
            <br/></i></p>
        <p>Mr. Miggs' felony suicide? Don't be silly. It has a certain pleasant symmetry, though, his <br/>swallowing
          that offensive tongue, don't you agree?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Officer Starling, that was a lie. The first one you've told me. A <i>triste </i>occasion,
          <br/></p>
        <p>Truman would say.&quot; <br/>&quot;President Truman?&quot; <br/>&quot;Never mind. Why do you think I helped
          you?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't know.&quot; <br/>&quot;Jack Crawford likes you, doesn't he?&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          don't know.&quot; <br/>&quot;That's probably untrue. Would you like for him to like you? Tell me, do you feel
          <br/></p>
        <p>an urge to please him and does it worry you? Are you <i>wary </i>of your urge to please him. <br/>&quot;Everyone
          wants to be liked, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/>&quot;Not everyone. Do you think Jack Crawford wants you sexually?
          I'm sure he's <br/></p>
        <p>very frustrated now. Do you think he visualizes... scenarios, transactions... fucking with <br/>you?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's not a matter of curiosity to me, Dr. Lecter, and it's the sort of thing Miggs <br/>would ask.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Not anymore.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you suggest to him that he swallow his tongue?&quot; <br/>&quot;Your

        mine. You say you don't know why Crawford helps you--- do you know why I <br/>did?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, tell me.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you think it's because I like to look at you and think about eating
          you up--- <br/></p>
        <p>about how you would taste?&quot; <br/>&quot;Is that it?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. I want something Crawford can

        <p>he won't come to see me. He won't ask for my help with Buffalo Bill, even though he <br/>knows it means more
          young women will die. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I can't believe that, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/>&quot;I only want something very simple, and he could get
          it.&quot; Lecter turned up the <br/></p>

        <p>leave the orderly will turn the sound back up, and my attorney can't stop it, the way the <br/>court is
          inclined toward me now. I want to be in a federal institution and I want my books <br/>back and a view. I'll
          give good value for it. Crawford could do that. Ask him.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I can tell him what you've said.&quot; <br/>&quot;He'll ignore it. And Buffalo Bill will go on and on.
          Wait until he scalps one and <br/></p>
        <p>see how you like it. Ummmm... I'll tell you one thing about Buffalo Bill without ever <br/>seeing the case,
          and years from now when they catch him, if they ever do, you'll see that I <br/>was right and I could have
          helped. I could have saved lives. Clarice?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes?&quot; <br/>&quot;Buffalo Bill has a two-story house,&quot; Dr. Lecter said, and turned out his
          light. <br/>He would not speak again. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 10 <br/> <br/>C</b>larice Starling leaned
          against a dice table in the FBI's casino and tried to pay <br/></p>
        <p>attention to a lecture on money-laundering in gambling. It had been thirty-six hours since <br/>the Baltimore
          County police took her deposition (via a chain-smoking two-finger typist: <br/>&quot;See if you can get that
          window open if the smoke bothers you.&quot;) and dismissed her from <br/>its jurisdiction with a reminder that
          murder is not a federal crime. <br/></p>
        <p>The network news on Sunday night showed Starling's scrap with the television <br/>cameramen and she felt sure
          she was deep in the glue. Through it all, no word from <br/>Crawford or from the Baltimore field office. It
          was as though she had dropped her report <br/>down a hole. <br/></p>
        <p>The casino where she now stood was small--- it had operated in a moving trailer <br/>truck until the FBI
          seized it and installed it in the school as a teaching aid. The narrow <br/>room was crowded with police from
          many jurisdictions; Starling had declined with </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>thanks the chairs of two Texas Rangers and a Scotland Yard detective. <br/>The rest of her class were down
        the hall in the Academy building, searching for <br/></p>
        <p>hairs in the genuine motel carpet of the &quot;Sex-Crime Bedroom&quot; and dusting the &quot;Anytown <br/>Bank&quot;
          for fingerprints. Starling had spent so many hours on searches and fingerprints as a <br/>Forensic Fellow that
          she was sent instead to this lecture, part of a series for visiting <br/>lawmen. <br/></p>
        <p>She wondered if there was another reason she had been separated from the class: <br/>maybe they isolate you
          before you get the ax. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling rested her elbows on the pass line of the dice table and tried to <br/>concentrate on
          money-laundering in gambling. What she thought about instead was how <br/>much the FBI hates to see its agents
          on television, outside of official news conferences. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Hannibal Lecter was catnip to the media, and the Baltimore police had <br/>happily supplied Starling's
          name to reporters. Over and over she saw herself on the <br/>Sunday-night network news. There was &quot;Starling
          of the FBI&quot; in Baltimore, banging the <br/>jack handle against the garage door as the cameraman tried to
          slither under it. And here <br/>was &quot;Federal Agent Starling&quot; turning on the assistant with the jack
          handle in her hand. <br/></p>
        <p>On the rival network, station WPIK, lacking film of its own, had announced a <br/>personal-injury lawsuit
          against &quot;Starling of the FBI&quot; and the Bureau itself because the <br/>cameraman got dirt and rust
          particles in his eyes when Starling banged the door. <br/></p>
        <p>Jonetta Johnson of WPIK was on coast-to-coast with the revelation that Starling <br/>had found the remains in
          the garage through an &quot;eerie bonding with a man authorities <br/>have branded... a <i>monster!</i>&quot;
          Clearly, WPIK had a source at the hospital. <br/></p>
        <p>BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN!! screamed the <i>National Tattler </i>from its <br/>supermarket racks. <br/></p>
        <p>There was no public comment from the FBI, but there was plenty inside the <br/>Bureau, Starling was sure.
          <br/></p>
        <p>At breakfast, one of her classmates, a young man who wore a lot of Canoe after-<br/>shave, had referred to
          Starling as &quot;Melvin Pelvis,&quot; a stupid play on the name of Melvin <br/>Purvis, Hoover's number-one
          G-man in the thirties. What Ardelia Mapp said to the young <br/>man made his face turn white, and he left his
          breakfast uneaten on the table. <br/></p>
        <p>Now Starling found herself in a curious state in which she could not be surprised. <br/>For a day and a night
          she'd felt suspended in a diver's ringing silence. She intended to <br/>defend herself, if she got the chance.
          <br/></p>
        <p>The lecturer spun the roulette wheel as he talked, but he never let the ball drop. <br/>Looking at him,
          Starling was convinced that he had never let the ball drop in his life. He <br/>was saying something now:
          &quot;Clarice Starling.&quot; Why was he saying &quot;Clarice, Starling?&quot; <br/><i>That's me. <br/></i>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. <br/>The lecturer pointed with his chin at the door behind her. Here it came. Her
          fate <br/></p>
        <p>shied under her as she turned to see. But it was Brigham, the gunnery instructor, leaning <br/>into the room
          to point to her across the crowd. When she saw him, he beckoned. <br/></p>
        <p>For a second she thought they were throwing her out, but that wouldn't be <br/>Brigham's job. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Saddle up, Starling. Where's your field gear?&quot; he said in the hall. <br/>&quot;My room--- C Wing.&quot;
          <br/>She had to walk fast then to keep up with him. </p>

          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Where?&quot; <br/>&quot;Some duck hunters in West Virginia found a body in the Elk River around <br/>

          not inclined to wait on those guys for details.&quot; Brigham stopped at the door to <br/>C Wing. &quot;He
          needs somebody to help him that can print a floater, among other things. <br/>You were a grunt in the lab---
          you can do that, right?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yeee, let me check the stuff.&quot; <br/>Brigham held the fingerprint kit open while Starling lifted
          out the trays. The fine <br/></p>
        <p>hypodermics and the vials were there, but the camera wasn't. <br/>&quot;I need the one-to-one Polaroid, the
          CU-5, Mr. Brigham, and film packs and <br/></p>
        <p>batteries for it.&quot; <br/>&quot;From property? You got it.&quot; <br/>He handed her the small canvas bag,
          and when she felt its weight, she realized <br/></p>
        <p>why it was Brigham who had come for her. <br/>&quot;You don't have a duty piece yet, right?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;You gotta have full kit. This is the rig you've been wearing on the range. The gun <br/></p>
        <p>is my own. It's the same K-frame Smith you're trained with, but the action's cleaned up. <br/>Dry-fire it in
          your room tonight when you get the chance. I'll be in a car behind C Wing <br/>in ten minutes flat with the
          camera. Listen, there's no head in the Blue Canoe. Go to the <br/>bathroom while you've got the chance is my
          advice. Chop-chop, Starling.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>She tried to ask him a question, but he was leaving her. <br/><i>Has </i>to be Buffalo Bill, if Crawford's
          going himself. What the hell is the Blue <br/></p>
        <p>Canoe? But you have to think about packing when you pack. Starling packed fast and <br/>well. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Is it---&quot; <br/>&quot;That's okay,&quot; Brigham interrupted as she got in the car. &quot;The butt
          prints against <br/></p>
        <p>your jacket a little if somebody's looking for it, but it's okay for now.&quot; She was wearing <br/>the
          snub-nosed revolver under her blazer in a pancake holster snug against her ribs, with <br/>a speedloader
          straddling her belt on the other side. <br/></p>
        <p>Brigham drove at precisely the base speed limit toward the Quantico airstrip. <br/>He cleared his throat.
          &quot;One good thing about the range, Starling, is there's no <br/></p>
        <p>politics out there.&quot; <br/>&quot;No?&quot; <br/>&quot;You were right to secure that garage up at
          Baltimore there. You worried about <br/></p>
        <p>the TV?&quot; <br/>&quot;Should I be?&quot; <br/>&quot;We're talking just us, right?&quot; <br/>&quot;Right.&quot;
          <br/>Brigham returned the greeting of a Marine directing traffic. <br/>&quot;Taking you along today, Jack's

      <div><p>your jacket in front of him and his bowels in an uproar, understand what I'm telling you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Ummm.&quot;
        <br/>&quot;Crawford's a stand-up guy. He made it clear where it matters that you had to <br/></p>
        <p>secure the scene. He let you go in there bare--- that is, bare of all your visible symbols of <br/>authority,
          and he said that too. And the response time of the Baltimore cops was pretty <br/>slow. Also, Crawford needs
          the help today, and he'd have to wait an hour for Jimmy Price <br/>to get somebody here from the lab. So you
          got it cut out for you, Starling. A floater's no <br/>day at the beach, either. It's not punishment for you,
          but if somebody outside needed to <br/>see it that way, they could. See, Crawford is a very subtle guy, but
          he's not inclined to <br/>explain things, that's why I'm telling you... If you're working with Crawford, you
          should <br/>know what the deal is with him--- do you know?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I really don't.&quot; <br/>&quot;He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill. His wife Bella's real
          sick. She's... <br/></p>
        <p>in a terminal situation. He's keeping her at home. If it wasn't for Buffalo Bill, he'd have <br/>taken
          compassionate leave.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I didn't know that.&quot; <br/>&quot;It's not discussed. Don't tell him you're sorry or anything, it
          doesn't help him... <br/></p>
        <p>they had a good time.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm glad you told me.&quot; <br/>Brigham brightened as they reached
          the airstrip. &quot;I've got a couple of important <br/></p>
        <p>speeches I give at the end of the firearms course, Starling, try not to miss them.&quot; He took <br/>a
          shortcut between some hangars. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I will.&quot; <br/>&quot;Listen, what I teach is something you probably won't ever have to do. I hope
          you <br/></p>
        <p>won't. But you've got some aptitude, Starling. If you have to shoot, you can shoot. Do <br/>your exercises.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Right.&quot; <br/>&quot;Don't ever put it in your purse.&quot; <br/>&quot;Right.&quot; <br/>&quot;Pull
          it a few times in your room at night. Stay so you can find it.&quot; <br/>&quot;I will.&quot; <br/>A venerable
          twin-engined Beechcraft stood on the taxiway at the Quantico airstrip <br/></p>
        <p>with its beacons turning and the door open. One propeller was spinning, riffling the grass <br/>beside the
          tarmac. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That wouldn't be the Blue Canoe,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;Yep.&quot; <br/>&quot;It's little and
          it's old.&quot; <br/>&quot;It <i>is </i>old,&quot; Brigham said cheerfully. &quot;Drug Enforcement seized it
          in Florida a long <br/></p>
        <p>time ago, when it flopped in the 'Glades. Mechanically sound now, though. I hope <br/>Gramm and Rudman don't
          find out we're using it--- we're supposed to ride the bus.&quot; He <br/>pulled up beside the airplane and got
          Starling's baggage out of the backseat. In some <br/>confusion of hands he managed to, give her the stuff and
          shake her hand. <br/></p>
        <p>And then, without meaning to, Brigham said, &quot;Bless you, Starling.&quot; The words <br/>felt odd in his
          Marine mouth. He didn't know where they came from and his face felt hot. <br/></p>

        <p>him. Crawford looked pale and tough, like a root a bulldozer pushes up. <br/>&quot;Take a pew and read,&quot;
          is all he said. <br/>A thick case file lay on the seat behind him. The cover said BUFFALO BILL. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling hugged it tight as the Blue Canoe blatted and shuddered and began to roll. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER
          11 <br/> <br/>T</b>he edges of the runway blurred and fell away. To the east, a flash of morning <br/></p>
        <p>sun off the Chesapeake Bay as the small plane turned out of traffic. <br/>Clarice Starling could see the
          school down there, and the surrounding Marine <br/></p>
        <p>base at Quantico. On the assault course, tiny figures of Marines scrambled and ran. <br/>This was how it
          looked from above. <br/>Once after a night-firing exercise, walking in the dark along the deserted Hogan's
          <br/></p>
        <p>Alley, walking to think, she had heard airplanes roar over and then, in the new silence, <br/>voices calling
          in the black sky above her--- airborne troops in a night jump calling to each <br/>other as they came down
          through the darkness. And she wondered how it felt to wait for <br/>the jump light at the aircraft door, how
          it felt to plunge into the bellowing dark. <br/></p>
        <p>Maybe it felt like this. <br/>She opened the file. <br/>He had done it five times that they knew of, had
          Bill. At least five times, and <br/></p>
        <p>probably more, over the past ten months he had abducted a woman, killed her and <br/>skinned her. (Starling's
          eye raced down the autopsy protocols to the free histamine tests <br/>to confirm that he killed them before he
          did the rest.) <br/></p>
        <p>He dumped each body in running water when he was through with it. Each was <br/>found in a different river,
          downstream from an interstate highway crossing, each in a <br/>different state. Everyone knew Buffalo Bill was
          a traveling man. That was all the law <br/>knew about him, absolutely all, except that he had at least one
          gun. It had six lands and <br/>grooves, left-hand twist--- possibly a Colt revolver or a Colt clone. Skidmarks
          on <br/>recovered bullets indicated he preferred to fire .38 Specials in the longer chambers of a <br/>.357.
          <br/></p>
        <p>The rivers left no fingerprints, no trace evidence of hair or fiber. <br/>He was almost certain to be a white
          male: white because serial murderers usually <br/></p>
        <p>kill within their own ethnic group and all the victims were white; male because female <br/>serial murderers
          are almost unknown in our time. <br/></p>
        <p>Two big-city columnists had found a headline in e.e. cummings' deadly little <br/>poem &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;:...
          <i>how do you like your blueeyed boy Mister Death <br/></i></p>
        <p>Someone, maybe Crawford, had pasted the quotation inside the cover of the file. <br/>There was no clear
          correlation between where Bill abducted the young women <br/></p>
        <p>and where he dumped them. <br/>In the cases where the bodies were found soon enough for an accurate <br/></p>
        <p>determination of time of death, police learned another thing the killer did: Bill kept them <br/>for a while,
          alive. These victims did not die until a week to ten days after they were <br/>abducted. That meant he had to
          have a place to keep them and a place to work in privacy. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>It meant he wasn't a drifter. He was more of a trapdoor spider. With his own digs. Some-<br/>where. <br/>
      </p>
        <p>That horrified the public more than anything--- his holding them for a week or <br/>more, knowing he would
          kill them. <br/></p>
        <p>Two were hanged, three shot. There was no evidence of rape or physical abuse <br/>prior to death, and the
          autopsy protocols recorded no evidence of &quot;specifically genital&quot; <br/>disfigurement, though
          pathologists noted it would be almost impossible to determine <br/>these things in the more deteriorated
          bodies. <br/></p>
        <p>All were found naked. In two cases, articles of the victims' outer clothing were <br/>found beside the road
          near their homes, slit up the back like funeral suits. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling got through the photographs all right. Floaters are the worst kind of dead <br/>to deal with,
          physically. There is an absolute pathos about them, too, as there often is <br/>about homicide victims out of
          doors. The indignities the victim suffers, the exposure to <br/>the elements and to casual eyes, anger you if
          your job permits you anger. <br/></p>
        <p>Often, at indoor homicides, evidences of a victim's unpleasant personal practices, <br/>and the victim's own
          victims--- beaten spouses, abused children--- crowd around to <br/>whisper that the dead one had it coming,
          and many times he did. <br/></p>
        <p>But nobody had this coming. Here they had not even their skins as they lay on <br/>littered riverbanks amid
          the outboard-oil bottles and sandwich bags that are our common <br/>squalor. The cold-weather ones largely
          retained their faces. Starling reminded herself that <br/>their teeth were not bared in pain, that turtles and
          fish in the course of feeding had created <br/>that expression. Bill peeled the torsos and mostly left the
          limbs alone. <br/></p>
        <p>They wouldn't have been so hard to look at, Starling thought, if this airplane cabin <br/>wasn't so warm and
          if the damned plane didn't have this crawly yaw as one prop caught <br/>the air better than the other, and if
          the God damned sun didn't splinter so on the scratched <br/>windows and jab like a headache. <br/></p>
        <p>It's possible to catch him. Starling squeezed on that thought to help herself sit in <br/>this ever-smaller
          airplane cabin with her lap full of awful information. She could help <br/>stop him cold. Then they could put
          this slightly sticky, smooth-covered file back in the <br/>drawer and turn the key on it. <br/></p>
        <p>She stared at the back of Crawford's head. If she wanted to stop Buffalo Bill she <br/>was in the right
          crowd. Crawford had organized successful hunts for three serial <br/>murderers. But not without casualties.
          Will Graham, the keenest hound ever to run in <br/>Crawford's pack, was a legend at the Academy; he was also a
          drunk in Florida now with <br/>a face that was hard to look at, they said. <br/></p>
        <p>Maybe Crawford felt her staring at the back of his head. He climbed out of the <br/>copilot's seat. The pilot
          touched the trim wheel as Crawford came back to her and <br/>buckled in beside her. When he folded his
          sunglasses and put on his bifocals, she felt she <br/>knew him again. <br/></p>
        <p>When he looked from her face to the report and back again, something passed <br/>behind his face and was
          quickly gone. A more animated mug than Crawford's would have <br/>shown regret. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm hot, are you hot?&quot; he said. &quot;Bobby, it's too damned hot in here,&quot; he called to <br/>the
          pilot. Bobby adjusted something and cold air came in. A few snowflakes formed in <br/>the moist cabin air and
          settled in Starling's hair. <br/></p>
        <p>Then it was Jack Crawford hunting, his eyes like a bright winter day. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>He opened the file to a map of the Central and Eastern United States. Locations <br/>where bodies had been
        found were marked on the map--- a scattering of dots as mute and <br/>crooked as Orion. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford took a pen from his pocket and marked the newest location, their <br/>objective. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Elk River, about six miles below U.S. 79,&quot; he said. &quot;We're lucky on this one. The <br/>body
          was snagged on a trotline--- a fishing line set out in the river. They don't think she's <br/>been in the
          water all that long. They're bringing her to Potter, the county seat. I want to <br/>know who she is in a
          hurry so we can sweep for witnesses to the abduction. We'll send <br/>the prints back on a land line as soon
          as we get 'em.&quot; Crawford tilted his head to look at <br/>Starling through the bottoms of his glasses.
          &quot;Jimmy Price says you can do a floater.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Actually, I never had an entire floater,&quot; Starling said. &quot;I fingerprinted the hands <br/>Mr.
          Price got in his mail every day. A good many of them were from floaters, though.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Those who have 'never been under Jimmy Price's supervision believe him to be a <br/>lovable curmudgeon. Like
          most curmudgeons, he is really a mean old man. Jimmy Price <br/>is a supervisor in Latent Prints at the
          Washington lab. Starling did time with him as a <br/>Forensic Fellow. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That Jimmy,&quot; Crawford said fondly. &quot;What is it they call that job...&quot; <br/>&quot;The
          position is called 'lab wretch,' or some people prefer 'Igor'--- that's what's <br/></p>
        <p>printed on the rubber apron they give you.&quot; <br/>&quot;That's it.&quot; <br/>&quot;They tell you to
          pretend you're dissecting a frog.&quot; <br/>&quot;I see---&quot; <br/>&quot;Then they bring you a package
          from UPS. They're all watching--- some of them <br/></p>
        <p>hurry back from coffee, hoping you'll barf. I can print a floater very well. In fact---&quot; <br/>&quot;Good,
          now look at this. His first victim that we know of was found in the <br/></p>
        <p>Blackwater River in Missouri, outside of Lone Jack, last June. The Bimmel girl, she'd <br/>been reported
          missing in Belvedere, Ohio, on April 15, two months before. We couldn't <br/>tell a lot about it--- it took
          another three months just to get her identified. The next one he <br/>grabbed in Chicago the third week in
          April. She was found in the Wabash in downtown <br/>Lafayette, Indiana, just ten days after she was taken, so
          we could tell what had happened <br/>to her. Next we've got a white female, early twenties, dumped in the
          Rolling Fork near I-<br/>65, about thirty-eight miles south of Louisville, Kentucky. She's never been
          identified. <br/>And the Varner woman, grabbed in Evansville, Indiana, and dropped in the Embarras just <br/>below
          Interstate 70 in eastern Illinois. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Then he moved south and dumped one in the Conasauga below Damascus, <br/>Georgia, down from Interstate
          75, that was this Kittridge girl from Pittsburgh--- here's her <br/>graduation picture. His luck's ungodly---
          nobody's ever seen him make a snatch. Except <br/>for the dumps being near an Interstate, we haven't seen any
          pattern.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;If you trace heaviest-traffic routes backward from the dump sites, do they <br/>converge at all?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;What if you... <i>postulate</i>... that he's making a dropoff and a new abduction
          on the <br/></p>
        <p>same trip?&quot; Starling asked, carefully avoiding the forbidden word <i>assume</i>. &quot;He'd drop off
          <br/>the body first, wouldn't he, in case he got in trouble grabbing the next one? Then, if he <br/>was caught
          grabbing somebody, he might get off for assault, plead it down to zip if he </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>didn't have a body in his car. So how about drawing vectors backward from each <br/>abduction site through
        the previous dump site? You've tried it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's a good idea, but he had it too. If he <i>is </i>doing both things in one trip, he's <br/>zigging
          around. We've run computer simulations, first with him westbound on the <br/>Interstates, then eastbound, then
          various combinations with the best dates we can put on <br/>the dumps and abductions. You put it in the
          computer and smoke comes out. He lives in <br/>the East, it tells us. He's not in a moon cycle, it tells us.
          No convention dates in the cities <br/>correlate. Nothing but feathers. No, he's seen us coming, Starling.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You think he's too careful to be a suicide.&quot; <br/>Crawford nodded. &quot;Definitely too careful.
          He's found out how to have a <br/></p>
        <p>meaningful relationship now, and he wants to do it a lot. I'm not getting my hopes up for <br/>a suicide.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford passed the pilot a cup of water from a thermos. He gave one to Starling <br/>and mixed himself an
          Alka-Seltzer. <br/></p>
        <p>Her stomach lifted as the airplane started down. <br/>&quot;Couple of things, Starling. I look for first-rate
          forensics from you, but I need <br/></p>
        <p>more than that. You don't say much, and that's okay, neither do I. But don't ever feel <br/>you've got to
          have a new fact to tell me before you can bring something up. There aren't <br/>any silly questions. You'll
          see things that I won't, and I want to know what they are. <br/>Maybe you've got a knack for this. All of a
          sudden we've got this chance to see if you <br/>do.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Listening to him, her stomach lifting and her expression properly rapt, Starling <br/>wondered how long
          Crawford had known he'd use her on this case, how hungry for a <br/>chance he had wanted her to be. He was a
          leader, with a leader's frank-and-open bullshit, <br/>all right. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You think about him enough, you see where he's been, you get a feel for him,&quot; <br/>Crawford went
          on. &quot;You don't even dislike him all the time, hard as that is to believe. <br/>Then, if you're lucky, out
          of all the stuff you know, part of it plucks at you, tries to get <br/>your attention. Always tell me when
          something plucks, Starling. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Listen to me, a crime is confusing enough without the investigation mixing it up. <br/>Don't let a herd
          of policemen confuse you. Live right behind your eyes. Listen to <br/>yourself. Keep the crime separate from
          what's going on around you now. Don't try to <br/>impose any pattern or symmetry on this guy. Stay open and
          let him show you. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;One other thing: an investigation like this is a zoo. It's spread out over a lot of <br/>jurisdictions,
          and a few are run by losers. We have to get along with them so they won't <br/>hold out on us. We're going to
          Potter, West Virginia. I don't know about these people <br/>we're going to. They may be fine or they may think
          we're the revenuers.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The pilot lifted an earphone away from his head and spoke over his shoulder. <br/>&quot;Final approach, Jack.
          You staying back there?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;School's out, Starling.&quot; <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 12 <br/>
          <br/>N</b>ow here is the Potter Funeral Home, the largest white frame house on Potter <br/></p>
        <p>Street in Potter, West Virginia, serving as the morgue for Rankin County. The coroner is </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>a family physician named Dr. Akin. If he rules that a death is questionable, the body is <br/>sent on to
        Claxton Regional Medical Center in the neighboring county, where they have a <br/>trained pathologist. <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice Starling, riding into Potter from the airstrip in the back of a sheriff's <br/>department cruiser,
          had to lean up close to the prisoner screen to hear the deputy at the <br/>wheel as he explained these things
          to Jack Crawford. <br/></p>
        <p>A service was about to get under way at the mortuary. The mourners in their <br/>country Sunday best filed up
          the sidewalk between leggy boxwoods and bunched on the <br/>steps, waiting to get in. The freshly painted
          house and the steps had, each in its own <br/>direction, settled slightly out of plumb. <br/></p>
        <p>In the private parking lot behind the house, where the hearses waited, two young <br/>deputies and one old
          one stood with two state troopers under a bare elm. It was not cold <br/>enough for their breath to steam.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Starling looked at these men as the cruiser pulled into the lot, and at once she <br/>knew about them. She
          knew they came from houses that had chifforobes instead of <br/>closets and she knew pretty much what was in
          the chifforobes. She knew that these men <br/>had relatives who hung their clothes in suitbags on the walls of
          their trailers. She knew <br/>that the older deputy had grown up with a pump on the porch and had waded to the
          road <br/>in the muddy spring to catch the school bus with his shoes hanging around his neck by <br/>the
          laces, as her father had done. She knew they had carried their lunches to school in <br/>paper sacks with
          grease spots on them from being used over and over and that after lunch <br/>they folded the sacks and slipped
          them in the back pockets of their jeans. <br/></p>
        <p>She wondered how much Crawford knew about their them. <br/>There were no handles on the inside of the rear
          doors in the cruiser, as Starling <br/></p>
        <p>discovered when the driver and Crawford got out and started toward the back of the <br/>funeral home. She had
          to bat on the glass until one of the deputies beneath the tree saw <br/>her, and the driver came back
          red-faced to let her out. <br/></p>
        <p>The deputies watched her sidelong as she passed. One said &quot;ma'am.&quot; She gave <br/>them a nod and a
          smile of the correct dim wattage as she went to join Crawford on he <br/>back porch. <br/></p>
        <p>When she was far enough away, one of the younger deputies, a newlywed, <br/>scratched beneath his jaw and
          said, &quot;She don't look half as good as she thinks she does.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Well, if she just thinks she looks <i>pretty got-damned good,</i> I'd have to agree with <br/>her,
          myself,&quot; the other young deputy said. &quot;I'd put her on like a Mark Five gas mask.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'd just as soon have a big watermelon, if it was cold,&quot; the older deputy said, half <br/>to
          himself. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was already talking to the chief deputy, a small, taut man in steel-<br/>rimmed glasses and the kind
          of elastic-sided boots the catalogs call &quot;Romeos.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>They had moved into the funeral home's dim back corridor, where a Coke <br/>machine hummed and random odd
          objects stood against the wall--- a treadle sewing <br/>machine, a tricycle, and a roll of artificial grass, a
          striped canvas awning wrapped around <br/>its poles. On the wall was a sepia print of Saint Cecilia at the
          keyboard. Her hair was <br/>braided around her head, and roses tumbled onto the keys out of thin air. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;I appreciate your letting us know so fast, Sheriff,&quot; Crawford said. <br/>The chief deputy wasn't
          having any. &quot;It was somebody from the district attorney's <br/></p>
        <p>office called you,&quot; he said. &quot;I know the sheriff didn't call you--- Sheriff Perkins is on a </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>guided tour of Hawaii at the present time with Mrs. Perkins. I spoke to him on long <br/>distance this
        morning at eight o'clock, that's three A.M., Hawaii time. He'll get back to <br/>me later in the day, but he
        told me Job One is to find out if this is one of our local girls. It <br/>could be something that outside
        elements has just dumped on us. We'll tend to that before <br/>we do anything else. We've had 'em haul bodies
        here all the way from Phenix City, <br/>Alabama.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's where we can help you, Sheriff. If---&quot; <br/>&quot;I've been on the phone with the field
          services commander of the state troopers in <br/></p>
        <p>Charleston. He's sending some officers from the Criminal Investigation Section--- what's <br/>known as the
          CIS. They'll give us all the backup we need.&quot; The corridor was filling with <br/>deputy sheriffs and
          troopers; the chief deputy had too much of an audience. &quot;We'll get <br/>around to you just as soon as we
          can, and extend you ever courtesy, work with you ever <br/><i>way </i>we can, but right now---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sheriff, this kind of a sex crime has some aspects that I'd rather say to you just <br/>between us men,
          you understand what I mean?&quot; Crawford said, indicating Starling's <br/>presence with a small movement. of
          his head. He hustled the smaller man into a cluttered <br/>office off the hall and closed the door. Starling
          was left to mask her umbrage before the <br/>gaggle of deputies. Her teeth hard together, she gazed on Saint
          Cecilia and returned the <br/>saint's ethereal smile while eavesdropping through the door. She could hear
          raised voices, <br/>then scraps of a telephone conversation. They were back out in the hall in less than four
          <br/>minutes. <br/></p>
        <p>The chief deputy's mouth was tight. &quot;Oscar, go out front and get Dr. Akin. He's <br/>kind of obliged to
          attend those rites, but I don't think they've got started out there yet. Tell <br/>him we've got Claxton on
          the phone.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The coroner, Dr. Akin, came to the little office and stood with his foot on a chair, <br/>tapping his front
          teeth with a Good Shepherd fan while he had a brief telephone <br/>conference with the pathologist in Claxton.
          Then he agreed to everything. <br/></p>
        <p>So, in an embalming room with cabbage roses in the wallpaper and a picture <br/>molding beneath its high
          ceiling, in a white frame house of a type she understood, Clarice <br/>Starling met with her first direct
          evidence of Buffalo Bill. <br/></p>
        <p>The bright green body bag, tightly zipped, was the only modern object in the <br/>room. It lay on an
          old-fashioned porcelain embalming table, reflected many times in the <br/>glass panes of cabinets holding
          trochars and packages of Rock-Hard Cavity Fluid. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford went to the car for the fingerprint transmitter while Starling unpacked <br/>her equipment on the
          drainboard of a large double sink against the wall. <br/></p>
        <p>Too many people were in the room. Several deputies, the chief deputy, all had <br/>wandered in with them and
          showed no inclination to leave. It wasn't right.<i> Why didn't <br/>Crawford come on and get rid of them?
            <br/></i></p>
        <p>The wallpaper billowed in a draft, billowed inward as the doctor turned on the <br/>big, dusty vent fan.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice Starling, standing at the sink, needed now a prototype of courage more apt <br/>and powerful than any
          Marine parachute jump. The image came to her, and helped her, <br/>but it pierced her too: <br/></p>
        <p><i>Her mother, standing at the sink, washing blood out of her father's hat, running <br/>cold water over the
          hat, saying, &quot;We'll be all right Clarice. Tell your brothers and sister <br/>to wash up and come to the
          table. We need to talk and then we'll fix our supper. &quot; </i></p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Starling took off her scarf and tied it over her hair like a mountain midwife. She <br/>took a pair of
        surgical gloves out of her kit. When she opened her mouth for the first time <br/>in Potter, her voice had more
        than its normal twang and the force of it brought Crawford <br/>to the door to listen. &quot;Gentlemen.
        Gentlemen! You officers and gentlemen! Listen here a <br/>minute. Please. Now let me take care of her.&quot; She
        held her hands before their faces as she <br/>pulled on the gloves. &quot;There's things we need to do for her.
        You brought her this far, and <br/>I know her folks would thank you if they could. Now please go on out and let
        me take <br/>care of her.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford saw them suddenly go quiet and respectful and urge each other out in <br/>whispers: &quot;Come on,
          Jess. Let's go out in the yard.&quot; And Crawford saw that the <br/>atmosphere had changed here in the
          presence of the dead: that wherever this victim came <br/>from, whoever she was, the river had carried her
          into the country, and while she lay <br/>helpless in this room in the <br/></p>
        <p>country, Clarice Starling had a special relationship to her. Crawford saw that in <br/>this place Starling
          was heir to the granny women, to the wise women, the herb healers, <br/>the stalwart country women who have
          always done the needful, who keep the watch and <br/>when the watch is over, wash and dress the country dead.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Then there were only Crawford and Starling and the doctor in the room with the <br/>victim, Dr. Akin and
          Starling looking at each other with a kind of recognition. Both of <br/>them were oddly pleased, oddly
          abashed. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford took a jar of Vicks VapoRub out of his pocket and offered it around. <br/>Starling watched to see
          what to do, and when Crawford and the doctor rubbed it around <br/>the rims of their nostrils, she did too.
          <br/></p>
        <p>She dug her cameras out of the equipment bag on the drainboard, her back to the <br/>room. Behind her she
          heard the zipper of the body bag go down. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling blinked at the cabbage roses on the wall, took a breath and let it out. She <br/>turned around and
          looked at the body on the table. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;They should have put paper bags on her hands,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll bag them when <br/>we're
          through.&quot; Carefully, overriding the automatic camera to bracket her exposures, <br/>Starling photographed
          the body. <br/></p>
        <p>The victim was a heavy-hipped young woman sixty-seven inches long by <br/>Starling's tape. The water had
          leached her gray where the skin was gone, but it had been <br/>cold water and she clearly hadn't been in it
          more than a few days. The body was flayed <br/>neatly from a clean line just below the breasts to the knees,
          about the area that would be <br/>covered by a bullfighter's pants and sash. <br/></p>
        <p>Her breasts were small and between them, over the sternum, was the apparent <br/>cause of death, a ragged,
          star-shaped wound a hand's breadth across. <br/></p>
        <p>Her round head was peeled to the skull from just above the eyebrows and ears to <br/>the nape. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter said he'd start scalping,&quot; Starling said. <br/>Crawford stood with his arms folded
          while she took the pictures. &quot;Get her ears <br/></p>
        <p>with the Polaroid,&quot; was all he said. <br/>He went so far as to purse his lips as he walked around the
          body. Starling peeled <br/></p>
        <p>off her glove to trail her finger up the calf of the leg. A section of the trotline and treble <br/>fishhooks
          that had entangled and held the body in the moving river was still wrapped <br/>around the lower leg. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;What do you see, Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Well, she's not a local--- her ears are pierced three
        times each, and she wore <br/></p>
        <p>glitter polish. Looks like town to me. She's got maybe two weeks or so hair growth on her <br/>legs. And see
          how soft it's grown in? I think she got her legs waxed. Armpits too. Look <br/>how she bleached the fuzz on
          her upper lip. She was pretty careful about herself, but she <br/>hasn't been able to take care of it for a
          while.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What about the wound?'' <br/>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Starling said. &quot;I would have said an exit
          gunshot wound, except <br/></p>
        <p>that looks like part of an abrasion collar and a muzzle stamp at the top there.&quot; <br/>&quot;Good,
          Starling. It's a contact entrance wound over the sternum. The explosion <br/></p>
        <p>gases expand between the bone and the skin and blow out the star around the hole.&quot; <br/>On the other
          side of the wall a pipe organ wheezed as the service got under way in <br/></p>
        <p>the front of the funeral home. <br/>&quot;Wrongful death,&quot; Dr. Akins contributed, nodding his head.
          &quot;I've got to get in <br/></p>
        <p>there for at least part of this service. The family always expects me to go the last mile. <br/>Lamar will be
          in here to help you as soon as he finishes playing the musical offering. I <br/>take you at your word on
          preserving evidence for the pathologist at Claxton, Mr. <br/>Crawford.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;She's got two nails broken off here on the left hand,&quot; Starling said when the <br/>doctor was
          gone. &quot;They're broken back up in the quick and it looks like dirt or some hard <br/>particles driven up
          under some of the others. Can we take evidence?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Take samples of grit, take a couple of flakes of polish,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;We'll <br/>tell 'em
          after we get the results.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Lamar, a lean funeral home assistant with a whiskey bloom in the middle of his <br/>face, came in while she
          was doing it. &quot;You must of been a manicurist one time,&quot; he said. <br/></p>
        <p>They were glad to see the young woman had no fingernail marks in her palms--- <br/>an indication that, like
          the others, she had died before anything else was done to her. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You want to print her facedown, Starling?&quot; Crawford said. <br/>&quot;Be easier.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let's
          do teeth first, and then Lamar can help us turn her over.&quot; <br/>&quot;Just pictures, or a chart?&quot;
          Starling attached the dental kit to the front of the <br/></p>
        <p>fingerprint camera, privately relieved that all the parts were in the bag. <br/>&quot;Just pictures,&quot;
          Crawford said. &quot;A chart can throw you off without X rays. We can <br/></p>
        <p>eliminate a couple of missing women with the pictures.&quot; <br/>Lamar was very gentle with his organist's
          hands, opening the young woman's <br/></p>
        <p>mouth at Starling's direction and retracting her lips while Starling placed the one-to-one <br/>Polaroid
          against the face to get details of the front teeth. That part was easy, but she had <br/>to shit the molars
          with a palatal reflector, watching from the side for the glow through the <br/>cheek to be sure the strobe
          around the lens was lighting the inside of the mouth. She had <br/>only seen it done in a forensics class.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Starling watched the first Polaroid print of the molars develop, adjusted the <br/>lightness control and
          tried again. This print was better. This one was very good. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;She's got something in her throat,&quot; Starling said. <br/>Crawford looked at the picture. It showed
          a dark cylindrical object just behind the <br/></p>
        <p>soft palate. &quot;Give me the flashlight.&quot; <br/>&quot;When a body comes out of the water, a lot of
          times there's like leaves and things </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>in the mouth,&quot; Lamar said, helping Crawford to look. <br/>Starling took some forceps out of her bag.
        She looked at Crawford across the <br/></p>
        <p>body. He nodded. It only took her a second to get it. <br/>&quot;What is it, some kind of seed pod?&quot;
          Crawford said. <br/>&quot;Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon,&quot; Lamar said. He was right. <br/>Starling put it in
          a jar. <br/>&quot;You might want the county agent to look at that,&quot; Lamar said. <br/>Facedown, the body
          was easy to fingerprint. Starling had been prepared for the <br/></p>
        <p>worst--- but none of the tedious and delicate injection methods or finger stalls were <br/>necessary. She
          took the prints on thin card stock held in a device shaped like a shoehorn. <br/>She did a set of plantar
          prints as well, in case they had only baby footprints from a <br/>hospital for reference. <br/></p>
        <p>Two triangular pieces of skin were missing from high on the shoulders. Starling <br/>took pictures. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Measure too,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;He cut the girl from Akron when he slit her <br/>clothes off,
          not much more than a scratch, but it matched the cut up the back of her <br/>blouse when they found it beside
          the road. This is something new, though. I haven't seen <br/>this.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Looks like a burn across the back of her calf,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;Old people gets those a
          lot,&quot; Lamar said. <br/>&quot;What?&quot; Crawford said. <br/><i>&quot;I SAID OLD PEOPLE GETS THOSE A LOT.&quot;
            <br/></i>&quot;I heard you fine, I want you to explain it. What about old people?&quot; <br/>&quot;Old
          people pass away with a heating pad on them, and when they're dead it burns <br/></p>
        <p>them, even when it's not all that hot. You burn under a heating pad when you're dead. No <br/>circulation
          under it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;We'll ask the pathologist at Claxton to test it, and see if it's postmortem,&quot; <br/>Crawford said
          to Starling. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Car muffler, most likely,&quot; Lamar said. <br/>&quot;What?&quot; <br/><i>&quot;CAR MUFFL--- </i>car
          muffler. One time Billy Petrie got shot to death and they <br/></p>
        <p>dumped him in the trunk of his car? His wife drove the car around two or three days <br/>looking for him.
          When they brought him in here, the muffler had got hot under the car <br/>trunk and burned him just like that,
          only across his hip,&quot; Lamar said. &quot;I can't put groceries <br/>in the trunk of my car for it melting
          the ice cream.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's a good thought, Lamar, I wish you worked for me,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;Do <br/>you know the
          fellows that found her in the river?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Jabbo Franklin and his brother, Bubba.&quot; <br/>&quot;What do they do?&quot; <br/>&quot;Fight at the
          Moose, make fun of people that's not bothering them--- someone just <br/></p>
        <p>comes in the Moose after a simple drink, worn out from looking at the bereaved all day, <br/>and it's 'Set
          down there, Lamar, and play &quot;Filipino Baby.&quot; ' Make a person play 'Filipino <br/>Baby' over and over
          on that sticky old bar piano. That's what Jabbo likes. 'Well, make up <br/>some damn words if you don't know
          it,' he says, 'and make the damn thing rhyme this <br/>time.' He gets a check from the Veterans and goes to
          dry out at the VA around Christmas. <br/>I been looking for him on this table for fifteen years.&quot; </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;We'll need serotonin tests on the fishhook punctures,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;I'm <br/>sending
        the pathologist a note.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Them hooks are too close together,&quot; Lamar said. <br/>&quot;What did you say?&quot; <br/>&quot;The
          Franklins was running a trotline with the hooks too close together. It's a <br/></p>
        <p>violation. That's prob'ly why they didn't call it in until this morning.&quot; <br/>&quot;The sheriff said
          they were duck hunters.&quot; <br/>&quot;I expect they did tell him that,&quot; Lamar said. &quot;They'll tell
          you they wrestled Duke <br/></p>
        <p>Keomuka in Honolulu one time too, tag team with Satellite Monroe. You can believe that <br/>too, if you feel
          like it. Grab a croaker sack and they'll take you on a snipe hunt too, if you <br/>favor snipe. Give you a
          glass of billiards with it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What do you think happened, Lamar?&quot; <br/>&quot;The Franklins was running this trotline, it's their
          trotline with these unlawful <br/></p>
        <p>hooks, and they was pulling it up to see if they had any fish.&quot; <br/>&quot;Why do you think so?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;This lady's not near ready to float.&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Then if they hadna been
          pulling up on the trotline they never would have found <br/></p>
        <p>her. They prob'ly went off scared and finally called in. I expect you'll want the game <br/>warden in on
          this.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I expect so,&quot; Crawford said. <br/>&quot;Lots of times they've got a crank telephone behind the
          seat in their Ramcharger, <br/></p>
        <p>that's a big fine right there, if you don't have to go to the pen.&quot; <br/>Crawford raised his eyebrows.
          <br/>&quot;To telephone fish with,&quot; Starling said. &quot;Stun the fish with electric current when <br/>
        </p>
        <p>you hang the wires in the water and turn the crank. They come to the top and you just dip <br/>'em out.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Right,&quot; Lamar said, &quot;are you from around here?&quot; <br/>&quot;They do it lots of places,&quot;
          Starling said. <br/>Starling felt the urge to say something before they zipped up the bag, to make a <br/></p>
        <p>gesture or express some kind of commitment. In the end, she just shook her head and got <br/>busy packing the
          samples into her case. <br/></p>
        <p>It was different with the body and problem out of sight. In this slack moment, <br/>what she'd been doing
          came in on her. Starling stripped off her gloves and turned the <br/>water on in the sink. With her back to
          the room, she ran water over her wrists. The water <br/>in the pipes wasn't all that cool. Lamar, watching,
          disappeared into the hall. He came <br/>back from the Coke machine with an ice-cold can of soda, unopened, and
          offered it to <br/>her. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, thanks,&quot; Starling said. &quot;I don't believe I'll have one.&quot; <br/>&quot;No, hold it
          under your neck there,&quot; Lamar said, &quot;and on that little bump at the <br/></p>
        <p>back of your head. Cold'll make you feel better. It does me.&quot; <br/>By the time Starling had finished
          taping the memo to the pathologist across the <br/></p>
        <p>zipper of the body bag, Crawford's fingerprint transmitter was clicking on the office desk. <br/>Finding this
          victim so soon after the crime was a lucky break. Crawford was <br/></p>
        <p>determined to identify her quickly and start a sweep around her home for witnesses to the <br/>abduction. His
          method was a lot of trouble to everyone, but it was fast. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Crawford carried a Litton Policefax fingerprint transmitter. Unlike federal-issue <br/>facsimile machines,
        the Policefax is compatible with most big-city police department <br/>systems. The fingerprint card Starling had
        assembled was barely dry. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Load it, Starling, you've got the nimble fingers.&quot; <br/><i>Don't smear it</i> was what he meant,
          and Starling didn't. It was hard, wrapping the <br/></p>
        <p>glued-together composite card around the little drum while six wire rooms waited around <br/>the country.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was on the telephone to the FBI switchboard and wire room in <br/>Washington. &quot;Dorothy, is
          everybody on? Okay, gentlemen, we'll turn it down to one-<br/>twenty to keep it nice and sharp--- check
          one-twenty, everybody? Atlanta, how about it? <br/>Okay, give me the picture wire... now.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Then it was spinning at slow speed for clarity, sending the dead woman's prints <br/>simultaneously to the
          FBI wire room and major police department wire rooms in the East. <br/>If Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta, or any of
          the others got a hit on the fingerprints, a sweep <br/>would begin in minutes. <br/></p>
        <p>Next Crawford sent pictures of the victim's teeth and photos of her face, the head <br/>draped by Starling
          with a towel in the event the supermarket press got hold of the <br/>photographs. <br/></p>
        <p>Three officers of the West Virginia State Police Criminal Investigation Section <br/>arrived from Charleston
          as they were leaving. Crawford did a lot of handshaking, passing <br/>out cards with the National Crime
          Information Center hotline number. Starling was <br/>interested to see how fast he got them into a male
          bonding mode. They sure would call up <br/>with anything they got, they sure would. You betcha and much
          oblige. Maybe it wasn't <br/>male bonding, she decided; it worked on her too. <br/></p>
        <p>Lamar waved with his fingers from the porch as Crawford and Starling rode away <br/>with the deputy toward
          the Elk River. The Coke was still pretty cold. Lamar took it into <br/>the storeroom and fixed a refreshing
          beverage for himself. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 13 <br/> <br/>&quot;D</b>rop me at the lab, Jeff,&quot; Crawford told the driver.
          &quot;Then I want you to wait for <br/></p>
        <p>Officer Starling at the Smithsonian. She'll go on from there to Quantico.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;
          <br/>They were crossing the Potomac River against the after-dinner traffic, coming <br/></p>
        <p>into downtown Washington from National Airport. <br/>The young man at the wheel seemed in awe of Crawford and
          drove with excessive <br/></p>
        <p>caution, Starling thought. She didn't blame him; it was an article of faith at the Academy <br/>that the last
          agent who'd committed a Full Fuck-Up in Crawford's command now investi-<br/>gated pilfering at DEW-line
          installations along the Arctic Circle. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was not in a good humor. Nine hours had passed since he transmitted <br/>the fingerprints and
          pictures of the victim, and she remained unidentified. Along with the <br/>West Virginia troopers, he and
          Starling had worked the bridge and the riverbank until <br/>dark without result. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had heard him on the phone from the airplane, arranging for an evening <br/>nurse at home. </p>

        <p>&quot;I'll post the hotline and the Latent Descriptor Index when I take your prints up to <br/>ID,&quot;
          Crawford said. &quot;You draft me an insert for the file. An insert, not a 302--- do you <br/>know how to do
          it?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I know how.&quot; <br/>&quot;Say I'm the Index, tell me what's new.&quot; <br/>It took her a second to
          get it together--- she was glad Crawford seemed interested <br/></p>
        <p>in the scaffolding on the Jefferson Memorial as they passed by. <br/>The Latent Descriptor Index in the
          Identification Section's computer compares the <br/></p>
        <p>characteristics of a crime under investigation to the known proclivities of criminals on <br/>file. When it
          finds pronounced similarities, it suggests suspects and produces their <br/>fingerprints. Then a human
          operator compares the file fingerprints with latent prints <br/>found at the scene. There were no prints yet
          on Buffalo Bill, but Crawford wanted to be <br/>ready. <br/></p>
        <p>The system requires brief, concise statements. Starling tried to come up with <br/>some. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;White female, late teens or early twenties, shot to death, lower torso and thighs <br/>flayed---&quot;

        <p>&quot;Starling, the Index already knows he kills young white women and skins their <br/>torsos--- use
          'skinned,' by the way, 'flayed' is an uncommon term another officer might <br/>not use, and you can't be sure
          the damned thing will read a synonym. It already knows he <br/>dumps them in rivers. It doesn't know what's
          <i>new </i>here. What's new here, Starling?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;This is the sixth victim, the first one scalped, the first one with triangular patches <br/>taken from
          the back of the shoulders, the first one shot in the chest, the first one with a <br/>cocoon in her throat.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You forgot broken fingernails.&quot; <br/>&quot;No sir, she's the .second one with broken fingernails.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;You're right. Listen, in your insert for the file, note that the cocoon is <br/></p>
        <p>confidential. We'll use it to eliminate false confessions.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm wondering if he's done that
          before--- placed a cocoon or an insect,&quot; Starling <br/></p>
        <p>said. &quot;It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater. You know, the <br/>medical
          examiner sees an obvious cause of death, it's hot in there, and they want to get <br/>through... can we check
          back on that?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;If we have to. You can count on the pathologists to say they didn't miss anything, <br/>naturally. The
          Cincinnati Jane Doe's still in 'the freezer out there. I'll ask them to look at <br/>her, but the other four
          are in the ground. Exhumation orders stir people up. We had to do <br/>it with four patients who passed away
          under Dr. Lecter's care, just to make sure what <br/>killed them. Let me tell you, it's a lot of trouble and
          it upsets the relatives. I'll do it if I <br/>have to, but we'll see what you find out at the Smithsonian
          before I decide.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Scalping... that's rare, isn't it?&quot; <br/>&quot;Uncommon, yes,&quot; Crawford said. <br/>&quot;But
          Dr. Lecter said Buffalo Bill would do it. How did he know that?&quot; <br/>&quot;He didn't know it.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;He said it, though.&quot; <br/>&quot;It's not a big surprise, Starling. I wasn't surprised to see
          that. I should have said </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>that it was rare until the Mengel case, remember that? Scalped the woman? There were <br/>two or three
        copycats after that. The papers, when they were playing around with the <br/>Buffalo Bill tag, they emphasized
        more than once that this killer doesn't take scalps. It's <br/>no surprise after that--- he probably follows his
        press. Lecter was guessing. He didn't say <br/><i>when </i>it would happen, so he could never be wrong. If we
        caught Bill and there was no <br/>Scalping, Lecter could say we got him just <i>before </i>he did it.&quot;
        <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter also said Buffalo Bill lives in a two-story house. We never got into <br/>that. Why do you
          suppose he said it?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's not a guess. He's very likely right, and he could have told you why, but he <br/>wanted to tease
          you with it. It's the only weakness I ever saw in him--- he has to look <br/>smart, smarter than anybody. He's
          been doing it for years.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You said ask if I don't know--- well, I have to ask you to explain that.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay, two of
          the victims were hanged, right? High ligature marks, cervical <br/></p>
        <p>displacement, definite hanging. As Dr. Lecter knows from personal experience, Starling, <br/>it's very hard
          for one person to hang another against his will. People hang <i>themselves <br/></i>from doorknobs all the
          time. They hang themselves sitting down, it's easy. But it's hard to <br/>hang somebody else--- even when
          they're bound up, they manage to get their feet under <br/>them, if there's any support to find with their
          feet. A ladder's threatening. Victims won't <br/>climb it blindfolded and they sure won't climb it if they can
          see the noose. The way it's <br/>done is in a stairwell. Stairs are familiar. Tell them you're taking them up
          to use the <br/>bathroom, whatever, walk them up with a hood on, slip the noose on, and boot them off <br/>the
          top step with the rope fastened to the landing railing. It's the only good way in a <br/>house. Fellow in
          California popularized it. If Bill didn't have a stairwell, he'd kill them <br/>another way. Now give me those
          names, the senior deputy from Potter and the state <br/>police guy, the ranking officer.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling found them in her notepad, reading by a penlight held in her teeth. <br/>&quot;Good,&quot; Crawford
          said. &quot;When you're posting a hotline, Starling, always credit <br/></p>
        <p>the cops by name. They hear their own names, they get more friendly to the hotline. <br/>Fame helps them
          remember to call us if they get something. What does the burn on her <br/>leg say to you?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Depends if it's postmortem.&quot; <br/>&quot;If it is?&quot; <br/>&quot;Then he's got a closed truck or
          a van or a station wagon, something long.&quot; <br/>&quot;Why?&quot; <br/>&quot;Because the burn's across the
          back of her calf.&quot; <br/>They were at Tenth and Pennsylvania, in front of the new FBI headquarters that
          <br/></p>
        <p>nobody ever refers to as the J. Edgar Hoover Building. <br/>&quot;Jeff, you can let me out here,&quot;
          Crawford said. &quot;Right here, don't go underneath. <br/></p>
        <p>Stay in the car, Jeff, just pop the trunk. Come show me, Starling.&quot; <br/>She got out with Crawford while
          he retrieved his datafax and briefcase from the <br/></p>
        <p>luggage compartment. <br/>&quot;He hauled the body in something big enough for the body to be stretched out
          on <br/></p>
        <p>its back,&quot; Starling said. &quot;That's the only way the back of her calf would rest on the floor <br/>over
          the exhaust pipe. In a car trunk like this, she'd be curled up on her side and---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yeah, that's how I see it,&quot; Crawford said. <br/>She realized then that he'd gotten her out of the
          car so he could speak with her </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>privately. <br/>&quot;When I told that deputy he and I shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that burned
        <br/></p>
        <p>you, didn't it?&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure.&quot; <br/>&quot;It was just smoke. I wanted to get him by himself.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I know that.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay.&quot; Crawford slammed the trunk and turned away. <br/>Starling
          couldn't let it go. <br/>&quot;It matters, Mr. Crawford.&quot; <br/>He was turning back to her, laden with his
          fax machine and briefcase, and she had <br/></p>
        <p>his full attention. <br/>&quot;Those cops know who you are,&quot; she said. &quot;They look at you to see how
          to act.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>She stood steady, shrugged her shoulders, opened her palms. There it was, it was true. <br/>Crawford
          performed a measurement on his cold scales. <br/>&quot;Duly noted, Starling. Now get on with the bug.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Yes sir.&quot; <br/>She watched him walk away, a middle-aged man laden with cases and rumpled <br/>
        </p>
        <p>from flying, his cuffs muddy from the riverbank, going home to what he did at home. <br/>She would have
          killed for him then. That was one of Crawford's great talent <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 14 <br/> <br/>T</b>he
          Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History had been closed for <br/></p>
        <p>hours, but Crawford had called ahead and a guard waited to let Clarice Starling in the <br/>Constitution
          Avenue entrance. <br/></p>
        <p>The lights were dimmed in the closed museum and the air was still. Only the <br/>colossal figure of a South
          Seas chieftain facing the entrance stood tall enough for the <br/>weak ceiling light to shine on his face.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Starling's guide was a big black man in the neat turnout of the Smithsonian <br/>guards. She thought he
          resembled the chieftain as he raised his face to the elevator lights. <br/>There was a moment's relief in her
          idle fancy, like rubbing a cramp. <br/></p>
        <p>The second level above the great stuffed elephant, a vast floor closed to the <br/>public, is shared by the
          departments of Anthropology and Entomology. The an-<br/>thropologists call it the fourth floor. The
          entomologists contend it is the third. A few <br/>scientists from Agriculture say they have proof that it is
          the sixth. Each faction has a case <br/>in the old building with its additions and subdivisions. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling followed the guard into a dim maze of corridors walled high with wooden <br/>cases of
          anthropological specimens. Only the small labels revealed their contents. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Thousands of people in these boxes,&quot; the guard said. &quot;Forty thousand <br/>specimens.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>He found office numbers with his flashlight and trailed the light over the labels as <br/>they went along.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Dyak baby carriers and ceremonial skulls gave way to Aphids, and they left Man <br/>for the older and more
          orderly world of Insects. Now the corridor was walled with big <br/>metal boxes painted pale green. </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;Thirty million insects--- and the spiders on top of that. Don't lump the spiders in <br/>with the
        insects,&quot; the guard advised. &quot;Spider people jump all over you about that. There, <br/>the office
        that's lit. Don't try to come out by yourself. If they don't say they'll bring you <br/>down, call me at this
        extension, it's the guard office. I'll come get you.&quot; He gave her a <br/>card and left her. <br/></p>
        <p>She was in the heart of Entomology, on a rotunda gallery high above the great <br/>stuffed elephant. There
          was the office with the lights on and the door open. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Time, Pilch!&quot; A man's voice, shrill with excitement. &quot;Let's go here. Time!&quot; <br/>Starling
          stopped in the doorway. Two men sat at a laboratory table playing chess. <br/></p>
        <p>Both were about thirty, one black-haired and lean, the other pudgy with wiry red hair. <br/>They appeared to
          be engrossed in the chessboard. If they noticed Starling, they gave no <br/>sign. If they noticed the enormous
          rhinoceros beetle slowly making its way across the <br/>board, weaving among the chessmen, they gave no sign
          of that either. <br/></p>
        <p>Then the beetle crossed the edge of the board. <br/>&quot;Time, Roden,&quot; the lean one said instantly.
          <br/>The pudgy one moved his bishop and immediately turned the beetle around and <br/></p>
        <p>started it trudging back the other way. <br/>&quot;If the beetle just cuts across the corner, is time up
          then?&quot; Starling asked. <br/>&quot;Of course time's up then,&quot; the pudgy one said loudly, without
          looking up. &quot;Of <br/></p>
        <p><i>course </i>it's up then. How do <i>you </i>play? Do you make him cross the whole board? Who do <br/>you
          play against, a sloth?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I have the specimen Special Agent Crawford called about.&quot; <br/>&quot;I can't imagine why we didn't
          hear your siren,&quot; the pudgy one said. &quot;We're <br/></p>
        <p>waiting all night here to identify a <i>bug </i>for the FBI. Bugs're all we do. Nobody said <br/>anything
          about Special Agent Crawford's <i>specimen</i>. He should show his <i>specimen <br/></i>privately to his
          family doctor. Time, Pitch!&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'd love to catch your whole routine another time,&quot; Starling said, &quot;'but this is <br/>urgent,
          so let's do it now. Time, Pitch.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The black-haired one looked around at her, saw her leaning against the doorframe <br/>with her briefcase. He
          put the beetle on some rotten wood in a box and covered it with a <br/>lettuce leaf. <br/></p>
        <p>When he got up, he was tall. <br/>&quot;I'm Noble Pilcher,&quot; he said. &quot;That's Albert Roden. You need
          an insect identified? <br/></p>
        <p>We're happy to help you.&quot; Pilcher had a long friendly face, but his black eyes were a little <br/>witchy
          and too close together, and one of them had a slight cast that made it catch the <br/>light independently. He
          did not offer to shake hands. &quot;You are...?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Clarice Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let's see what you've got.&quot; <br/>Pilcher held the small jar to
          the light. <br/>Roden came to look. &quot;Where did you find it? Did you kill it with your <i>gun</i>? Did
          <br/></p>
        <p>you see its <i>mommy</i>?&quot; <br/>It occurred to Starling how much Roden would benefit from an elbow smash
          in <br/></p>
        <p>the hinge of his Jaw. <br/>&quot;Shhh, &quot; Pilcher said. &quot;Tell us where you found it. Was it attached
          to anything--- a <br/></p>
        <p>twig or a leaf--- or was it in the soil?&quot; <br/>&quot;I see,&quot; Starling said. &quot;Nobody's talked
          to you.&quot; </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;The Chairman asked us to stay late and identify a bug for the FBI,&quot; Pilcher said.
        <br/>&quot;<i>Told </i>us,&quot; Roden said. &quot;<i>Told </i>us to stay late.&quot; <br/>&quot;We do it all
        the time for Customs and the Department of Agriculture,&quot; Pilcher <br/></p>
        <p>said. <br/>&quot;But not in the middle of the night,&quot; Roden said. <br/>&quot;I need to tell you a couple
          of things involving a criminal case,&quot; Starling said. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm allowed to do that if you'll keep it in confidence until the case is resolved. It's <br/>important.
          It means some lives, and I'm not just saying that. Dr. Roden, can you tell me <br/>seriously that you'll
          respect a confidence?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm not a doctor. Do I have to sign anything?&quot; <br/>&quot;Not if your word's any good. You'll have
          to sign for the specimen if you need to <br/></p>
        <p>keep it, that's all.&quot; <br/>&quot;Of course I'll help you. I'm not <i>uncaring.&quot; <br/></i>&quot;Dr.
          Pilcher?&quot; <br/>&quot;That's true,&quot; Pilcher said. &quot;He's not uncaring.&quot; <br/>&quot;Confidence?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I won't tell.&quot; <br/>&quot;Pilch isn't a doctor yet either,&quot; Roden said. &quot;We're on an
          equal educational <br/></p>
        <p>footing. But notice how he <i>allowed </i>you to call him that.&quot; Roden placed the tip of his <br/>forefinger
          against his chin, as though pointing to his judicious expression. &quot;Give us all <br/>the details. What
          might seem irrelevant to <i>you </i>could be vital information to an expert.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;This insect was found lodged behind the soft palate of a murder victim. I don't <br/>know how it got
          there. Her body was in the Elk River in West Virginia, and she hadn't <br/>been dead more than a few days.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;It's Buffalo Bill, I heard it on the radio,&quot; Roden said. <br/>&quot;You didn't hear about the
          insect on the radio, did you?&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;No, but they said Elk River--- are you coming in
          from that today, is that why <br/></p>
        <p>you're so late?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;You must be tired, do you want some
          coffee?&quot; Roden said. <br/>&quot;No, thank you.&quot; <br/>&quot;Water?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;A
          Coke?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't believe so. We want to know where this woman was held captive and <br/></p>
        <p>where she was killed. We're hoping this bug has some specialized habitat, or it's limited <br/>in range, you
          know, or it only sleeps on some kind of tree--- we want to know where this <br/>insect is from. I'm asking for
          your confidence because--- if the perpetrator put the insect <br/>there deliberately---then only he would know
          that fact and we could use it to eliminate <br/>false confessions and save time. He's killed six at least.
          Time's eating us up.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Do you think he's holding another woman right this minute, while we're looking <br/>at his bug?&quot;
          Roden asked in her face. His eyes were wide and his mouth open. She could <br/>see into his mouth, and she
          flashed for a second on something else. <br/></p>
        <p><i>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</i> A little shrill, that. &quot;I don't know,&quot; she said again, to take the
          edge <br/>off it. &quot;He'll do it again as soon as he can.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So we'll do this as soon as we can,&quot; Pilcher said. &quot;Don't worry, we're good at </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>this. You couldn't be in better hands.&quot; He removed the brown object from the jar with a <br/>slender
        forceps and placed it on a sheet of white paper beneath the light. He swung a <br/>magnifying glass on a
        flexible arm over it. <br/></p>
        <p>The insect was long and it looked like a mummy. It was sheathed in a <br/>semitransparent cover that followed
          its general outlines like a sarcophagus. The <br/>appendages were bound so tightly against the body, they
          might have been carved in low <br/>relief. The little face looked wise. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;In the first place, it's not anything that would normally infest a body outdoors, <br/>and it wouldn't
          be in the water except by accident,&quot; Pilcher said. &quot;I don't know how <br/>familiar you are with
          insects or how much you want to hear.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Let's say I don't know diddly. I want you to tell me the whole thing.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay, this is a
          pupa, an immature insect, in a chrysalis--- that's the cocoon that <br/></p>
        <p>holds it while it transforms itself from a larva into an adult,&quot; Pilcher said. <br/>&quot;Obtect pupa,
          Pilch?&quot; Roden wrinkled his nose to hold his glasses up. <br/>&quot;Yeah, I think so. You want to pull
          down Chu on the immature insects? Okay, <br/></p>
        <p>this is the pupal stage of a large insect. Most of the more advanced insects have a pupal <br/>stage. A lot
          of them spend the winter this way.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Book or look, Pilch?&quot; Roden said. <br/>&quot;I'll look.&quot; Pilcher moved the specimen to the
          stage of a microscope and hunched <br/></p>
        <p>over it with a dental probe in his hand. &quot;Here we go: No distinct respiratory organs on the <br/>dorsocephalic
          region, spiracles on the mesothorax and some abdominals, let's start with <br/>that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p> &quot;Ummhumm,&quot; Roden said, turning pages in a small manual. &quot;Functional <br/>mandibles?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Nope.&quot; <br/>&quot;Paired galeae of maxillae on the ventro meson?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yep, yep.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Where are the antennae?&quot; <br/>&quot;Adjacent to the mesal margin of the wings. Two pairs of
          wings, the inside pair <br/></p>
        <p>are completely covered up. Only the bottom three abdominal segments are free. Little <br/>pointy cremaster---
          I'd say Lepidoptera.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's what it says here,&quot; Roden said. <br/>&quot;It's the family that includes the butterflies
          and moths. Covers a lot of territory,&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Pilcher said. <br/>&quot;It's gonna be tough if the wings are soaked. I'll pull the references,&quot; Roden
          said. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I guess there's no way I can keep you from talking about me while I'm gone.&quot; <br/>&quot;I guess
          not,&quot; Pilcher said. &quot;Roden's all right,&quot; he told Starling as soon as Roden <br/></p>
        <p>left the room. <br/>&quot;I'm sure he is.&quot; <br/>&quot;Are you now.&quot; Pilcher seemed amused. &quot;We
          were undergraduates together, <br/></p>
        <p>working and glomming any kind of fellowship we could. He got one where he had to sit <br/>down in a coal mine
          waiting for proton decay. He just stayed in the dark too long. He's all <br/>right. Just don't mention proton
          decay.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'll try to talk around it.&quot; <br/>Pilcher turned away from the bright light. &quot;It's a big
          family, Lepidoptera. Maybe <br/></p>
        <p>thirty thousand butterflies and a hundred thirty thousand moths. I'd like to take it out of </p>

      <div><p>the chrysalis--- I'll have to if we're going to narrow it down.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay. Can you do it in
        one piece?&quot; <br/>&quot;I think so. See, this one had started out on its own power before it died. It had
        <br/></p>
        <p>started an irregular fracture in the chrysalis right here. This may take a little while.&quot; <br/>Pilcher
          spread the natural split in the case and eased the insect out. The bunched <br/></p>
        <p>wings were soaked. Spreading them was like working with a wet, wadded facial tissue. <br/>No pattern was
          visible. <br/></p>
        <p>Roden was back with the books. <br/>&quot;Ready?&quot; Pitcher said. &quot;Okay, the prothoracic femur is
          concealed.&quot; <br/>&quot;What about pilifers?&quot; <br/>&quot;No pilifers,&quot; Pitcher said. &quot;Would
          you turn out the light, Officer Starling?&quot; <br/>She waited by the wall switch until Pilcher's penlight
          came on. He stood back <br/></p>
        <p>from the table and shined it on the specimen. The insect's eyes glowed in the dark, <br/>reflecting the
          narrow beam. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Owlet,&quot; Roden said. <br/>&quot;Probably, but which one?&quot; Pilcher said. &quot;Give us the
          lights, please. It's a <br/></p>
        <p>Noctuid, Officer Starling--- a night moth. How many Noctuids are there, Roden?&quot; <br/>&quot;Twenty-six
          hundred and... about twenty-six hundred have been described. <br/>&quot;Not many this big, though. Okay, let's
          see you shine, my man.&quot; <br/>Roden's wiry red head covered the microscope. <br/>&quot;We have to go to
          chaetaxy now--- studying the skin of the insect to narrow it <br/></p>
        <p>down to one species,&quot; Pitcher said. &quot;Roden's the best at it.&quot; <br/>Starling had the sense that
          a kindness had passed in the room. <br/>Roden responded by starting a fierce argument with Pilcher over
          whether the <br/></p>
        <p>specimen's larval warts were arranged in circles or not. It raged on through the ar-<br/>rangement of the
          hairs on the abdomen. <br/></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Erebus odora,&quot; </i>Roden said at last. <br/>&quot;Let's go look,&quot; Pilcher said. <br/>They
          took the specimen with them, down in the elevator to the level just above <br/></p>
        <p>the great stuffed elephant and back into an enormous quad filled with pale green boxes. <br/>What was
          formerly a great hall had been split into two levels with decks to provide more <br/>storage for the
          Smithsonian's insects. They were in Neotropical now, moving into <br/>Noctuids. Pilcher consulted his notepad
          and stopped at a box chest--- high in the great <br/>wall stack. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You have to be careful with these things,&quot; he said, sliding the heavy metal door <br/>off the box
          and setting it on the floor. &quot;You drop one on your foot and you hop for <br/>weeks.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>He ran his finger down the stacked drawers, selected one, and pulled it out. <br/>In the tray Starling saw
          the tiny preserved eggs, the caterpillar in a tube of <br/></p>
        <p>alcohol, a cocoon peeled away from a specimen very similar to hers, and the adult--- a <br/>big brown-black
          moth with a wingspan of nearly six inches, a furry body, and slender <br/>antennae. <br/></p>
        <p><i>'Erebus odora,&quot;</i> Pitcher said. &quot;The Black Witch Moth.&quot; <br/>Roden was already turning
          gages. &quot;'A tropical species sometimes straying up to <br/></p>
        <p>Canada in the fall,&quot; he read. &quot; `The larvae eat acacia, catclaw, and similar plants. <br/>Indigenous
          West Indies, Southern U.S., considered a pest in Hawaii.' &quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p><i>Fuckola, </i>Starling thought. &quot;Nuts,&quot; she said aloud, &quot;They're all over.&quot; <br/>&quot;But
        they're not all over all the time.&quot; Pilcher's head was down. He pulled at his <br/></p>
        <p>chin. &quot;Do they double-brood, Roden?&quot; <br/>&quot;Wait a second... yeah, in extreme south Florida and
          south Texas.&quot; <br/>&quot;When?&quot; <br/>&quot;May and August.&quot; <br/>&quot;I was just thinking,&quot;
          Pilcher said. &quot;Your specimen's a little better developed than <br/></p>
        <p>the one we have, and it's fresh. It had started fracturing its cocoon to come out. In the <br/>West Indies or
          Hawaii, maybe, I could understand it, but it's winter here. In this country it <br/>would wait three months to
          come out. Unless it happened accidentally in a greenhouse, or <br/>somebody raised it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Raised it how?&quot; <br/>&quot;In a cage, in a warm place, with some acacia leaves for the larvae to
          eat until <br/></p>
        <p>they're ready to button up in their cocoons. It's not hard to do.&quot; <br/>&quot;Is it a popular hobby?
          Outside professional study, do a lot of people do it?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, primarily it's entomologists trying
          to get a perfect specimen, maybe a few <br/></p>
        <p>collectors. There's the silk industry too, they raise moths, but not this kind.&quot; <br/>&quot;Entomologists
          must have periodicals, professional journals, people that sell <br/></p>
        <p>equipment,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;Sure, and most of the publications come here.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let
          me make you a bundle,&quot; Roden said. &quot;A couple of people here subscribe <br/></p>
        <p>privately to the smaller newsletters---keep 'em locked up and make you give them a <br/>quarter just to look
          at the stupid things. I'll have to get those in the morning.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'll see they're picked up, thank you, Mr. Roden.&quot; <br/>Pilcher photocopied the references on <i>Erebus
          odora</i> and gave them to her, along <br/></p>
        <p>with the insect. &quot;I'll take you down,&quot; he said. <br/>They waited for the elevator. &quot;Most
          people love butterflies and hate moths,&quot; he <br/></p>
        <p>said. &quot;But moths are more--- interesting, engaging.&quot; <br/>&quot;They're destructive.&quot; <br/>&quot;Some
          are, a lot are, but they live in all kinds of ways. Just like we do.&quot; Silence <br/></p>
        <p>for one floor. &quot;There's a moth, more than one in fact, that lives only on tears,&quot; he offered. <br/>&quot;That's
          all they eat or drink.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What kind of tears? Whose tears?&quot; <br/>&quot;The tears of large land mammals, about our size. The
          old definition of moth was <br/></p>
        <p>'anything that gradually, silently eats, consumes, or wastes any other thing.' It was a verb <br/>for
          destruction too... Is this what you do all the time--- hunt Buffalo Bill?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I do it all I can.&quot; <br/>Pilcher polished his teeth, his tongue moving behind his lips like a cat
          beneath the <br/></p>
        <p>covers. &quot;Do you ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer or the amusing house wine?&quot; <br/>&quot;Not
          lately.&quot; <br/>&quot;Will you go for some with me now? It's not far.&quot; <br/>&quot;No, but I'll treat
          when this is over--- and Mr. Roden can go too, naturally.&quot; <br/>&quot;There's nothing natural about that,&quot;
          Pilcher said. And at the door, &quot;I hope you're <br/></p>
        <p>through with this soon, Officer Starling.&quot; <br/>She hurried to the waiting car. <br/>Ardelia Mapp had
          left Starling's mail and half a Mounds candy bar on her bed. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Mapp was asleep. <br/>Starling carried her portable typewriter down to the laundry room, put it on the
        <br/></p>
        <p>clothes-folding shelf and cranked in a carbon set. She had organized her notes on <i>Erebus <br/>odora </i>in
          her head on the ride back to Quantico and she covered that quickly. <br/></p>
        <p>Then she ate the Mounds and wrote a memo to Crawford suggesting they cross-<br/>check the entomology
          publications' computerized mailing lists against the FBI's known <br/>offender files and the files in the
          cities closest to the abductions, plus felon and sex-<br/>offender files of Metro Dade, San Antonio, and
          Houston, the areas where the moths were <br/>most plentiful. <br/></p>
        <p>There was another thing, too, that she had to bring up for a second time: <i>Lets ask <br/>Dr. Lecter why he
          thought the perpetrator would start taking scalps. <br/></i></p>
        <p>She delivered the paper to the night duty officer and fell into her grateful bed, the <br/>voices of the day
          still whispering, softer than Mapp's breathing across the room. On the <br/>swarming dark she saw the moth's
          wise little face. Those glowing eyes had looked at <br/>Buffalo Bill. <br/></p>
        <p>Out of the cosmic hangover the Smithsonian leaves came her last thought and a <br/>coda for her day: <i>Over
          this odd world, this half the world that's dark now, I have to hunt <br/>a thing that lives on tears.

        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 15 <br/> <br/>I</b>n East Memphis, Tennessee, Catherine Baker Martin and her best
          boyfriend were <br/></p>
        <p>watching a late movie on television in his apartment and having a few hits off a bong <br/>pipe loaded with
          hashish. The commercial breaks grew longer and more frequent. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I've got the munchies, want some popcorn?&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;I'll go get it, give me your keys.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Sit still. I need to see if Mom called, anyway.&quot; <br/>She got up from the couch, a tall young
          woman, big-boned and well fleshed, <br/></p>
        <p>nearly heavy, with a handsome face and a lot of clean hair. She found her shoes under the <br/>coffee table
          and went outside. <br/></p>
        <p>The February evening was more raw than cold. A light fog off the Mississippi <br/>River hung breast-high over
          the big parking area. Directly overhead she could see the <br/>dying moon, pale and thin as a bone fishhook.
          Looking up made her a little dizzy. She <br/>started across the parking field, navigating steadily toward her
          own front door a hundred <br/>yards away. <br/></p>
        <p>The brown panel truck was parked near her apartment, among some motor homes <br/>and boats on trailers. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>She noticed it because it resembled the parcel delivery trucks which often brought <br/>presents from her
          mother. <br/></p>
        <p>As she passed near the truck, a lamp came on in the fog. It was a floor lamp with <br/>a shade, standing on
          the asphalt behind the truck. Beneath the lamp was an overstuffed <br/>armchair in red-flowered chintz, the
          big red flowers blooming in the fog. The two items <br/>were like a furniture grouping in a showroom. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Catherine Baker Martin blinked several times and kept going. She thought the <br/>word <i>surreal </i>and
          blamed the bong. She was all right. Somebody was moving in or </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>moving out. In. Out. Somebody was always moving at the Stonehinge Villas. The curtain <br/>stirred in her
        apartment and she saw her cat on the sill, arching and pressing his side <br/>against the glass. <br/></p>
        <p>She had her key ready, and before she used it she looked back. A man climbed out <br/>of the back of the
          truck. She could see by the lamplight that he had a cast on his hand and <br/>his arm was in a sling. She went
          inside and locked the door behind her. <br/></p>
        <p>Catherine Baker Martin peeped around the curtain and saw the man trying to put <br/>the chair into the back
          of the truck. He gripped it with his good hand and tried to boost it <br/>with his knee. The chair fell over.
          He righted it, licked his finger and rubbed at a spot of <br/>parking-lot grime on the chintz. <br/></p>
        <p>She went outside. <br/>&quot;Help you with that.&quot; She got the tone just right--- helpful and that's all.
          <br/>&quot;Would you? Thanks.&quot; An odd, strained voice. Not a local accent. <br/>The floor lamp lit his
          face from below, distorting his features, but she-could see <br/></p>
        <p>his body plainly. He had on pressed khaki trousers and some kind of chamois shirt, <br/>unbuttoned over a
          freckled chest. His chin and cheeks were hairless, as smooth as a <br/>woman's, and his eyes only pinpoint
          gleams above his cheekbones in the shadows of the <br/>lamp. <br/></p>
        <p>He looked at her too, and she was sensitive to that. Men were often surprised at <br/>her size when she got
          close to them and some concealed it better than others. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Good,&quot; he said. <br/>There was an unpleasant odor about the man, and she noticed with distaste
          that <br/></p>
        <p>his chamois shirt still had hairs on it, curly ones across the shoulders and beneath the <br/>arms. <br/></p>
        <p>It was easy lifting the chair onto the low floor of the truck. <br/>&quot;Let's slide it to the front, do you
          mind?&quot; He climbed inside and moved some <br/></p>
        <p>clutter, the big flat pans you can slide under a vehicle to drain the oil, and a small hand <br/>winch called
          a coffin hoist. <br/></p>
        <p>They pushed the chair forward until it was just behind the seats. <br/>&quot;Are you about a fourteen?&quot;
          he said. <br/>&quot;What?&quot; <br/>&quot;Would you hand me that rope? It's just at your feet.&quot; <br/>When
          she bent to look, he brought the plaster cast down on the back of her head. <br/></p>
        <p>She thought she'd bumped her head and she raised her hand to it as the cast came down <br/>again, smashing
          her fingers against her skull, and down again, this time behind her ear, a <br/>succession of blows, none of
          them too hard, as she slumped over the chair. She slid to the <br/>floor of the truck and lay on her side.
          <br/></p>
        <p>The man watched her for a second, then pulled off his cast and the arm sling. <br/>Quickly, he brought the
          lamp into the truck and closed the rear doors. <br/></p>
        <p>He pulled her collar back and, with a flashlight, read the size tag on her blouse. <br/>&quot;Good,&quot; he
          said. <br/>He slit the blouse up the back with a pair of bandage scissors, pulled the blouse <br/></p>
        <p>off, and handcuffed her hands behind her. Spreading a mover's pad on the floor of the <br/>truck, he rolled
          her onto her back. <br/></p>
        <p>She was not wearing a brassiere. He prodded her big breasts with his fingers and <br/>felt their weight and
          resilience. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;Good,&quot; he said. <br/>There was a pink suck mark on her left breast. He licked his finger to rub
        it as he <br/></p>
        <p>had done the chintz and nodded when the lividity went away with light pressure. He <br/>rolled her onto her
          face and checked her scalp, parting her thick hair with his fingers. The <br/>padded cast hadn't cut her.
          <br/></p>
        <p>He checked her pulse with two fingers on the side of her neck and found it strong. <br/>&quot;Gooood, &quot;
          he said. He had a long way to drive to his two-story house and he'd <br/></p>
        <p>rather not field-dress her here. <br/>Catherine Baker Martin's cat watched out the window as the truck pulled
          away, <br/></p>
        <p>the taillights getting closer and closer together. <br/>Behind the cat the telephone was ringing. The machine
          in the bedroom answered, <br/></p>
        <p>its red light blinking in the dark. <br/>The caller was Catherine's mother, the junior U.S. Senator from
          Tennessee. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 16 <br/> <br/>I</b>n the 1980s, the Golden Age of Terrorism, procedures
          were in place to deal with <br/></p>
        <p>a kidnapping affecting a member of Congress: <br/>At 2:45 A.M. the special agent in charge of the Memphis FBI
          office reported to <br/></p>
        <p>headquarters in Washington that Senator Ruth Martin's only daughter had disappeared. <br/>At 3:00 A.M. two
          unmarked vans pulled out of the damp basement garage at the <br/></p>
        <p>Washington field office, Buzzard's Point. One van went to the Senate Office Building, <br/>where technicians
          placed monitoring and recording equipment on the telephones in <br/>Senator Martin's office and put a Title 3
          wiretap on the pay phones closest to the <br/>Senator's office. The Justice Department woke the most junior
          member of the Senate <br/>Select Intelligence Committee to provide the obligatory notice of the tap. <br/></p>
        <p>The other vehicle, an &quot;eyeball van&quot; with one-way glass and surveillance <br/>equipment, was parked
          on Virginia Avenue to cover the front of the Watergate West, <br/>Senator Martin's Washington residence. Two
          of the van's occupants went inside to install <br/>monitoring equipment on the Senator's home telephones.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic estimated the mean trace time at seventy seconds on any ransom call <br/>placed from a domestic
          digital switching system. <br/></p>
        <p>The Reactive Squad at Buzzard's Point went to double shifts in the event of a <br/>ransom drop in the
          Washington area. Their radio procedure changed to mandatory <br/>encryption to protect any possible ransom
          drop from intrusion by news helicopters--- that <br/>kind of irresponsibility on the part of the news business
          was rare, but it had happened. <br/></p>
        <p>The Hostage Rescue Team went to an alert status one level short of airborne. <br/>Everyone hoped Catherine
          Baker Martin's disappearance was a professional <br/></p>
        <p>kidnapping for ransom; that possibility offered the best chance for her survival. <br/>Nobody mentioned the
          worst possibility of all. <br/>Then, shortly before dawn in Memphis, a city patrolman investigating a prowler
          <br/></p>
        <p>complaint on Winchester Avenue stopped an elderly man collecting aluminum cans and <br/>junk along the
          shoulder of the road. In his cart the patrolman found a woman's blouse, <br/>still buttoned in front. The
          blouse was slit up the back like a funeral suit. The laundry <br/>mark was Catherine Baker Martin's. </p>

        <p><br/>Jack Crawford was driving south from his home in Arlington at 6:30 A.M. when <br/></p>
        <p>the telephone in his car beeped for the second time in two minutes. <br/>&quot;Nine twenty-two forty.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Forty stand by for Alpha 4.&quot; <br/>Crawford spotted a rest area, pulled in, and stopped to give
          his full attention to the <br/></p>
        <p>telephone. Alpha 4 is the Director of the FBI. <br/>&quot;Jack--- you up on Catherine Martin?&quot; <br/>&quot;The
          night duty officer called me just now.&quot; <br/>&quot;Then you know about the blouse. Talk to me.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Buzzard Point went to kidnap alert,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;I'd prefer they didn't stand <br/>
        </p>
        <p>down yet. When they do stand down I'd like to keep the phone surveillance. Slit blouse or <br/>not, we don't
          know for sure it's Bill. If it's a copycat he might call for ransom. Who's <br/>doing taps and traces in
          Tennessee, us or them?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Them. The state police. They're pretty good. Phil Adler called from the White <br/>House to tell me
          about the President's 'intense interest.' We could use a win here, Jack.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That had occurred to me. Where's the Senator?&quot; <br/>&quot;En route to Memphis. She got me at home
          a minute ago. You can imagine.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Crawford knew Senator Martin from budget hearings.
          <br/>&quot;She's coming down with all the weight she's got.&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't blame her.&quot; <br/>&quot;Neither
          do I,&quot; the Director said. &quot;I've told her we're going flat-out, just as we've <br/></p>
        <p>done all along. She is... she's aware of your personal situation and she's offered you a <br/>company Lear.
          Use it--- come home at night if you can.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Good. The Senator's tough, Tommy. If she tries to run it we'll butt heads.&quot; <br/>&quot;I know. Do
          a set-pick off me if you have to. What have we got at the best--- six <br/></p>
        <p>or seven days, Jack?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't know. If he panics when he finds out who she is--- he might
          just do her <br/></p>
        <p>and dump her.&quot; <br/>&quot;Where are you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Two miles from Quantico.&quot; <br/>&quot;Will
          the strip at Quantico take a Lear?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Twenty minutes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes
          sir.&quot; <br/>Crawford punched numbers into his phone and pulled back into traffic. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER

        <p>slippers, towel over her shoulder, waiting to get in the bathroom she and Mapp shared <br/>with the students

      <div><p>&quot;Oh God,&quot; she said. &quot;Oh boy. ALL RIGHT IN THERE! THIS BATHROOM IS <br/>SEIZED. COME OUT
        WITH YOUR PANTS UP. THIS IS NOT A DRILL!&quot; She <br/>climbed into the shower with a startled next-door
        neighbor. &quot;Ooch over, Gracie, and <br/>would you pass me that soap.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Ear cocked to the telephone, she packed for overnight and set her forensic kit by <br/>the door. She made
          sure the switchboard knew she was in her room and gave up breakfast <br/>to stick by the phone. At ten minutes
          to class time, with no word, she hurried down to Be-<br/>havioral Science with her equipment. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Mr. Crawford left for Memphis forty-five minutes ago,&quot; the secretary told her <br/>sweetly. &quot;Burroughs
          went, and Stafford from the lab left from National.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I put a report here for him last night. Did he leave any message for me? I'm <br/>Clarice Starling.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, I know who you are. I have three copies of your telephone number right <br/>here, and there are
          several more on his desk, l believe. No, he didn't leave a thing for you, <br/>Clarice.&quot; The woman looked
          at Starling's luggage. &quot;Would you like me to tell him <br/>something when he calls in?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did he leave a Memphis phone number on his three-card?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, he'll call with it. Don't
          you have classes today, Clarice? You're still in <br/></p>
        <p>school, aren't you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes. Yes, I am.&quot; <br/>Starling's entry, late, into the classroom
          was not eased by Gracie Pitman, the <br/></p>
        <p>young woman she had displaced in the shower. Gracie Pitman sat directly behind <br/>Starling. It seemed a
          long way to her seat. Gracie Pitmans tongue had time to make two <br/>full-revolutions in her downy cheek
          before Starling could submerge into the class. <br/></p>
        <p>With no breakfast she sat through two hours of &quot;The Good-Faith Warrant <br/>Exception to the
          Exclusionary Rule in Search and Seizure,&quot; before she could get to the <br/>vending machine and chug a
          Coke. <br/></p>
        <p>She checked her box for a message at noon and there was nothing. It occurred to <br/>her then, as it had on a
          few other occasions in her life, that intense frustration tastes very <br/>much like the patent medicine
          called Fleet's that she'd had to take as a child. <br/></p>
        <p>Some days you wake up changed. This was one for Starling, she could tell. What <br/>she had seen yesterday at
          the Potter Funeral Home had caused in her a small tectonic <br/>shift. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had studied psychology and criminology in a good school. In her life she <br/>had seen some of the
          hideously offhand ways in which the world breaks things. But she <br/>hadn't really <i>known, </i>and now she
          knew: sometimes the family of man produces, behind a <br/>human face, a mind whose pleasure is what lay on the
          porcelain table at Potter, West <br/>Virginia, in the room with the cabbage roses. Starling's first
          apprehension of that mind <br/>was worse than anything she could see on the autopsy scales. The knowledge
          would lie <br/>against her skin forever, and she knew she had to form a callus or it would wear her <br/>through.
          <br/></p>
        <p>The school routine didn't help her. All day she had the feeling that things were <br/>going on just over the
          horizon. She seemed to hear a vast murmur of events, like the <br/>sound from a distant stadium. Suggestions
          of movement unsettled her, groups passing in <br/>the hallway, cloud shadows moving over, the sound of an
          airplane. <br/></p>
        <p>After class Starling ran too many laps and then she swam. She swam until she </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>thought about the floaters and then she didn't want the water on her anymore. <br/>She watched the seven
        o'clock news with Mapp and a dozen other students in the <br/></p>
        <p>recreation room. The abduction of Senator Martin's daughter was not the lead item, but it <br/>was first
          after the Geneva arms talks. <br/></p>
        <p>There was film from Memphis, starting with the sign of the Stonehinge Villas, <br/>shot across the revolving
          light of a patrol car. The media were blitzing the story and, with <br/>little new to report, reporters
          interviewed each other in the parking lot at Stonehinge. <br/>Memphis and Shelby County authorities ducked
          their heads to unaccustomed banks of <br/>microphones. In a jostling, squealing hell of lens flare and audio
          feedback, they listed the <br/>things they didn't know. Still-photographers stooped and darted, backpedaling
          into the <br/>TV minicams whenever investigators entered or left Catherine Baker Martin's apartment. <br/></p>
        <p>A brief, ironic cheer went up in the Academy recreation room when Crawford's <br/>face appeared briefly in
          the apartment window. Starling smiled on one side of her mouth. <br/></p>
        <p>She wondered if Buffalo Bill was watching. She wondered what he thought of <br/>Crawford's face or if he even
          knew who Crawford was. <br/></p>
        <p>Others seemed to think Bill might be watching, too. <br/>There was Senator Martin, on television live with
          Peter Jennings. She stood alone <br/></p>
        <p>in her child's bedroom, a Southwestern University pennant and posters favoring Wile E. <br/>Coyote and the
          Equal Rights Amendment on the wall behind her. <br/></p>
        <p>She was a tall woman with a strong, plain face. <br/>&quot;I'm speaking now to the person who is holding my
          daughter,&quot; she said. She <br/></p>
        <p>walked closer to the camera, causing an unscheduled refocus, and spoke as she never <br/>would have spoken to
          a terrorist. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You have the power to let my daughter go unharmed. Her name is Catherine. <br/>She's very gentle and
          understanding. Please let my daughter go, please release her <br/>unharmed. You have control of this
          situation. You have the power. You are in charge. I <br/>know you can feel love and compassion. You can
          protect her against anything that might <br/>want to harm her. You now have a wonderful chance to show the
          whole world that you <br/>are capable of great kindness, that you are big enough to treat others better than
          the world <br/>has treated you. Her name is Catherine.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Senator Martin's eyes cut away from the camera as the picture switched to a home <br/>movie of a toddler
          helping herself walk by hanging on to the mane of a large collie. <br/></p>
        <p>The Senator's voice went on: &quot;The film you're seeing now is Catherine as a little <br/>child. Release
          Catherine. Release her unharmed anywhere in this country and you'll have <br/>my help and my friendship.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Now a series of still photographs--- Catherine Martin at eight, holding the tiller of <br/>a sailboat. The
          boat was up on blocks and her father was painting the hull. Two recent <br/>photographs of the young woman, a
          full shot and a close-up of her face., <br/></p>
        <p>Now back to the Senator in close-up: &quot;I promise you in front of this entire <br/>country, you'll have my
          unstinting aid whenever you need it. I'm well equipped to help <br/>you. I am a United States Senator. I serve
          on the Armed Services Committee. I am deeply <br/>involved in the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space
          weapons systems which everyone <br/>calls 'Star Wars.' If you have enemies, I will fight them. If anyone
          interferes with you, I <br/>can stop them. You can call me at any time, day or night. Catherine is my
          daughter's <br/>name. Please, show us your strength,&quot; Senator Martin said in closing, &quot;release
          Catherine <br/>unharmed.&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;Boy, is that smart,&quot; Starling said. She was trembling like a terrier. &quot;Jesus, that's <br/>smart.&quot;
        <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What, the Star Wars?&quot; Mapp said. &quot;If the aliens are trying to control Buffalo <br/>Bill's
          thoughts from another planet, Senator Martin can protect him--- is that the pitch?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling nodded. &quot;A lot of paranoid schizophrenics have that specific <br/>hallucination--- alien
          control. If that's the way Bill's wired, maybe this approach could <br/>bring him out. It's a damn good shot,
          though, and she stood up there and fired it, didn't <br/>she? At the least it might buy Catherine a few more
          days. They may have time to work on <br/>Bill a little. Or they may not; Crawford thinks his period may be
          getting shorter. They can <br/><i>try </i>this, they can try other things.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Nothing I <i>wouldn't </i>try if he had one of mine. Why did she keep saying <br/>'Catherine,' why the
          name all the time?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;She's trying to make Buffalo Bill see Catherine as a person. They're thinking he'll <br/>have to
          depersonalize her, he'll have to see her as an object before he can tear her up. <br/>Serial murderers talk
          about that in prison interviews, some of them. They say it's like <br/>working on a doll.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Do you see Crawford behind Senator Martin's statement?&quot; <br/>&quot;Maybe, or maybe Dr. Bloom---
          there he is,&quot; Starling said. On the screen was an <br/></p>
        <p>interview taped several weeks earlier with Dr. Alan Bloom of the University of Chicago <br/>on the subject of
          serial murder. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Bloom refused to compare Buffalo Bill with Francis Dolarhyde or Garrett <br/>Hobbs, or any of the others
          in his experience. He refused to use the term &quot;Buffalo Bill.&quot; <br/>In fact he didn't say much at
          all, but he was known to be an expert, probably <i>the </i>expert on <br/>the subject, and the network wanted
          to show his face. <br/></p>
        <p>They used his final statement for the snapper at the end of the report: &quot;There's <br/>nothing we can
          threaten him with that's more terrible than what he faces every day. What <br/>we <i>can </i>do is ask him to
          come to us. We can promise him kind treatment and relief, and <br/>we can mean it absolutely and sincerely.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Couldn't we all use some relief,&quot; Mapp said. &quot;Damn if I couldn't use some relief <br/>myself.
          Slick obfuscation and facile bullshit, I love it. He didn't tell them anything, but <br/>then he probably
          didn't stir Bill up much either.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I can stop thinking about that kid in West Virginia for a while,&quot; Starling said, &quot;it <br/>goes
          away for, say, a half an hour at a time, and then it pokes me in the throat. Glitter <br/>polish on her
          nails--- let me not get into it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Mapp, rummaging among her many enthusiasms, lightened Starling's gloom at <br/>dinner and fascinated
          eavesdroppers by comparing slant-rhymes in the works of Stevie <br/>Wonder and Emily Dickinson. <br/></p>
        <p>On the way back to the room, Starling snatched a message out of her box and read <br/>this: <i>Please call
          Albert Roden, </i>and a telephone number. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That just proves my theory,&quot; she told Mapp as they flopped on their beds with <br/>their books.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What's that?&quot; <br/>&quot;You meet two guys, right? The wrong one'll call you every God damned
          time.&quot; <br/>&quot;I <i>been </i>knowing that.&quot; <br/>The telephone rang. <br/>Mapp touched the end of
          her nose with her pencil. &quot;If that's Hot Bobby Lowrance, </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>would you tell him I'm in the library?&quot; Mapp said. &quot;I'll call him tomorrow, tell him.&quot;
        <br/>It was Crawford calling from an airplane, his voice scratchy on the phone. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Starling, pack for two nights and meet me in an hour.&quot; <br/>She thought he was gone, there was
          only a hollow humming on the telephone, <br/></p>
        <p>then the voice came back abruptly:&quot; ---won't need the kit, just clothes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Meet you
          where?&quot; <br/>&quot;The Smithsonian.&quot; He started talking to someone else before he punched off. <br/>&quot;Jack
          Crawford,&quot; Starling said, flipping her bag on the bed. <br/>Mapp appeared over the top of her <i>Federal
            Code of Criminal Procedure. </i>She <br/></p>
        <p>watched Starling pack, an eyelid drooping over one of her great dark eyes. <br/>&quot;I don't want to put
          anything on your mind,&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;Yes you do,&quot; Starling said. She knew what was coming.
          <br/>Mapp had made the Law Review at the University of Maryland while working at <br/></p>
        <p>night. Her academic standing at the academy was number two in the class, her attitude <br/>toward the books
          was pure banzai. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You're supposed to take the Criminal Code exam tomorrow and the PE test in <br/>two days. You make sure
          Supremo Crawford knows you could get recycled if he's not <br/>careful. Soon as he says, 'Good work, Trainee
          Starling,' don't you say, 'The pleasure was <br/>mine.' You get right in his old Easter Island face and say,
          'I'm counting on you to see to it <br/><i>yourself </i>that I'm not recycled for missing school.' Understand
          what I'm saying?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I can get a makeup on the Code,&quot; Starling said, opening a barrette with her teeth. <br/>&quot;Right,
          and you fail it with no time to study, you think they won't recycle you? <br/></p>
        <p>Are you kidding me? Girl, they'll sail you off the back steps like a dead Easter chick. <br/>Gratitude's got
          a short half-life, Clarice. Make him say <i>no recycle</i>. You've got good <br/>grades--- make him say it. I
          never would find another roommate that can iron as fast as <br/>you can at one minute to class.&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p><br/>---------- <br/></p>
        <p><br/>Starling had her old Pinto moving up the four-lane at a steady lope, one mile an <br/></p>
        <p>hour below the speed where the shimmy sets in. The smells of hot oil and mildew, the <br/>rattles underneath,
          the transmission's whine resonated faintly with memories of her <br/>father's pickup truck, her memories of
          riding beside him with her squirming brothers and <br/>sister. <br/></p>
        <p>She was doing the driving now, driving at night, the white dashes passing under <br/>blip blip blip. She had
          time to think. Her fears breathed on her from close behind her <br/>neck; other, recent memories squirmed
          beside her. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling was very much afraid Catherine Baker Martin's body had been found. <br/>When Buffalo Bill found out
          who she was, he might have panicked. He might have killed <br/>her and dumped her body with a bug in the
          throat. <br/></p>
        <p>Maybe Crawford was bringing the bug to be identified. Why else would he want <br/>her at the Smithsonian? But
          any agent could carry a bug into the Smithsonian, an FBI <br/>messenger could do it for that matter. And he
          told her to pack for two days. <br/></p>
        <p>She could understand Crawford not explaining it to her over an unsecured radio <br/>link, but it was
          maddening to wonder. <br/></p>
        <p>She found an all-news station on the radio and waited through the weather report. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>When the news came, it was no help. The story from Memphis was a rehash of the seven <br/>o'clock news.
        Senator Martin's daughter was missing. Her blouse had been found slit up <br/>the back in the style of Buffalo
        Bill. No witnesses. The victim found in West Virginia <br/>remained unidentified. <br/></p>
        <p>West Virginia. Among Clarice Starling's memories of the Potter Funeral Home <br/>was something hard and
          valuable. Something durable, shining apart from the dark <br/>revelations. Something to keep. She deliberately
          recalled it now and found that she could <br/>squeeze it like a talisman. In the Potter Funeral Home, standing
          at the sink, she had found <br/>strength from a source that surprised and pleased her--- the memory of her
          mother. <br/>Starling was a seasoned survivor on hand-me-down grace from her late father through her <br/>brothers;
          she was surprised and moved by this bounty she had found. <br/></p>
        <p>She parked the Pinto beneath FBI headquarters at Tenth and Pennsylvania. Two <br/>television crews were set
          up on the sidewalk, reporters looking over-groomed in the <br/>lights. They were intoning standup reports with
          the J. Edgar Hoover Building in the <br/>background. Starling skirted the lights and walked the two blocks to
          the Smithsonian's <br/>National Museum of Natural History. <br/></p>
        <p>She could see a few lighted windows high in the old building. A Baltimore <br/>County Police van was parked
          in the semicircular drive. Crawford's driver, Jeff, waited at <br/>the wheel of a new surveillance van behind
          it. When he saw Starling coming, he spoke <br/>into a hand-held radio. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 18 <br/> <br/>T</b>he guard took Clarice Starling to the second level above the
          Smithsonian's great <br/></p>
        <p>stuffed elephant. The elevator door opened onto that vast dim floor and Crawford was <br/>waiting there
          alone, his hands in the pockets of his raincoat. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Evening, Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;Hello,&quot; she said. <br/>Crawford spoke over her shoulder to the
          guard. &quot;We can make it from here by <br/></p>
        <p>ourselves, Officer, thank you.&quot; <br/>Crawford and Starling walked side by side along a corridor in the
          stacked trays <br/></p>
        <p>and cases of anthropological specimens. A few ceiling lights were on, not many. As she <br/>fell with him
          into the hunched, reflective attitude of a campus stroll, Starling became <br/>aware that Crawford wanted to
          put his hand on her shoulder, that he would have done it if <br/>it were possible for him to touch her. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>She waited for him to say something. Finally she stopped, put her hands in her <br/>pockets too, and they
          faced each other across the passage in the silence of the bones. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford leaned his head back against the cases and took a deep breath through <br/>his nose. &quot;Catherine
          Martin's probably still alive,&quot; he said. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling nodded, kept her head down after the last nod. Maybe he would find it <br/>easier to talk if she
          didn't look at him. He was steady, but something had hold of him. <br/>Starling wondered for a second if his
          wife had died. Or maybe spending all day with <br/>Catherine's grieving mother had done it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Memphis was pretty much of a wipe,&quot; he said. &quot;He got her on the parking lot, I <br/>think.
          Nobody saw it. She went in her apartment and then she came back out for some </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>reason. She didn't mean to stay out long--- she left the door ajar and flipped the deadbolt <br/>so it
        wouldn't lock behind her. Her keys were on top of the TV. Nothing disturbed inside. <br/>I don't think she was
        in the apartment long. She never got as far as her answering <br/>machine in the bedroom. The message light was
        still blinking when her yo-yo boyfriend <br/>finally called the police.&quot; Crawford idly let his hand fall
        into a tray of bones, and quickly <br/>took it out again. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So now he's got her, Starling. The networks agreed not to do a countdown on the <br/>evening news---
          Dr. Bloom thinks it eggs him on. A couple of the tabloids'll do it <br/>anyway.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>In one previous abduction, clothing slit up the back had been found soon enough <br/>to identify a Buffalo
          Bill victim while she was still being held alive. Starling remembered <br/>the black-bordered countdown on the
          front pages of the trash papers. It reached eighteen <br/>days before the body floated. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So Catherine Baker Martin's waiting in BilYs green room, Starling, and we have <br/>maybe a week:
          That's at the outside--- Bloom thinks his period's getting shorter.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>This seemed like a lot of talk for Crawford. The theatrical &quot;green room&quot; reference <br/>smacked of
          bullshit. Starling waited for him to get to the point, and then he did. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;But this time, Starling, <i>this </i>time we may have a little break.&quot; <br/>She looked up at him
          beneath her brows, hopeful and watchful too. <br/>&quot;We've got another insect. Your fellows, Pilcher and
          that... other one.&quot; <br/>'Roden.&quot; <br/>&quot;They're working on it.&quot; . <br/>&quot;Where was
          it--- Cincinnati?--- the girl in the freezer?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. Come on and I'll show you. Let's see what
          you think about it.&quot; <br/>&quot;Entomology's the other way, Mr. Crawford.&quot; <br/>&quot;I know,&quot;
          he said. <br/>They rounded the corner to the door of Anthropology. Light and voices came <br/></p>
        <p>through the frosted glass. She went in. <br/>Three men in laboratory coats worked at a table in the center of
          the room beneath <br/></p>
        <p>a brilliant light. Starling couldn't see what they were doing. Jerry Burroughs from <br/>Behavioral Science
          was looking over their shoulders taking notes on a clipboard. There <br/>was a familiar odor in the room.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Then one of the men in white moved to put something in the sink and she could <br/>see all right. <br/></p>
        <p>In a stainless-steel, tray on the workbench was &quot;Klaus,&quot; the head she had found in <br/>the Split
          City MiniStorage. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Klaus had the bug in his throat,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;Hold on a minute, Starling. <br/>Jerry, are
          you talking to the wire room?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Burroughs was reading from his clipboard into the telephone. He put his hand <br/>over the mouthpiece. &quot;Yeah,
          Jack, they're drying the art on Klaus.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford took the receiver from him. &quot;Bobby, don't wait for the Interpol split. <br/>Get a picture wire
          and transmit the photographs now, along with the medical. <br/>Scandinavian countries, West Germany, the
          Netherlands. Be sure to say Klaus could be a <br/>merchant sailor that jumped ship. Mention that their
          National Health may have a claim <br/>for the cheekbone fracture. Call it the what, the zygomatic arch. Make
          sure you move <br/>both dental charts, the universal and the Federation Dentaire. They're coming with an </p>

      <div><p>age, but emphasize that it's a rough estimate--- you can't depend on skull sutures for that.&quot; <br/>He
        gave the phone back to Burroughs. &quot;Where's your gear, Starling?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;The guard office downstairs.&quot; <br/>&quot;Johns Hopkins found the insect,&quot; Crawford said as
          they waited for the elevator. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;They were doing the head for the Baltimore County police. It was in the throat, just like <br/>the girl
          in West Virginia.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Just like West Virginia.&quot; <br/>&quot;You clucked. Johns Hopkins found it about seven tonight. The
          Baltimore district <br/></p>
        <p>attorney called me on the plane. They sent the whole thing over, Klaus and all, so we <br/>could see it <i>in
          situ.</i> They also wanted an opinion from Dr. Angel on Klaus' age and how <br/>old he was when he fractured
          his cheekbone. They consult the Smithsonian just like we <br/>do.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I have to deal with this a second. You're saying maybe Buffalo Bill killed <i>Klaus</i>? <br/>Years
          ago?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Does it seem farfetched, too much of a coincidence?&quot; <br/>&quot;Right this second it does.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Let it cook a minute.&quot; <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter told me where to find Klaus,&quot; Starling said.
          <br/>&quot;Yes, he did.&quot; <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter told me his patient, Benjamin Raspail, claimed to have
          killed Klaus. <br/></p>
        <p>But Lecter said he believed it was probably accidental erotic asphyxia.&quot; <br/>&quot;That's what he said.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;You think maybe Dr. Lecter knows exactly how Klaus died, and it wasn't <br/></p>
        <p>Raspail, and it wasn't erotic asphyxia?&quot; <br/>&quot;Klaus had a bug in his throat, the girl in West
          Virginia had a bug in her throat. I <br/></p>
        <p>never saw that anywhere else. Never read about it, never heard of it. What do you think?&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          think you told me to pack for two days. You want me to ask Dr. Letter, don't <br/></p>
        <p>you.&quot; <br/>&quot;You're the one he talks to, Starling.&quot; Crawford looked so sad when he said, &quot;I
          <br/></p>
        <p>figure you're game.&quot; <br/>She nodded. <br/>&quot;We'll talk on the way to the asylum,&quot; he said.
          <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 19 <br/> <br/>&quot;D</b>r. Lecter had a big psychiatric practice for years before
          we caught him for the <br/></p>
        <p>murders,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;He did a slew of psychiatric evaluations for the Maryland and <br/>Virginia
          courts and some others up and down the East Coast. He's seen a lot of the <br/>criminally insane. Who knows
          what he turned loose, just for fun? That's one way he <br/>could know. Also, he knew Raspail socially and
          Raspail told him things in therapy. <br/>Maybe Raspail told him who killed Klaus.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford and Starling faced each other in swivel chairs in the back of the <br/>surveillance van, whizzing
          north on U.S. 95 toward Baltimore, thirty-seven miles away. <br/>Jeff, in the driver's compartment, clearly
          had orders to step on it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Lecter offered to help, and I had no part of him. I've had his help before. He gave </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>us nothing useful and he helped Will Graham get a knife jammed through his face last <br/>time. For fun.
        <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;But a bug in Klaus' throat, a bug in the girl's throat in West Virginia, I can't <br/>ignore that. Alan
          Bloom's never heard of that specific act before, and neither have I. Have <br/>you ever run across it before,
          Starling? You've read the literature since I have.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Never. Inserting other objects, yes, but never an insect.&quot; <br/>&quot;Two things to begin with.
          First, we go on the premise that Dr. Lecter really <br/></p>
        <p>knows something concrete. Second, we remember that Lecter looks only for the fun. <br/>Never forget fun. He
          has to want Buffalo Bill caught while Catherine Martin's still alive. <br/>All the fun and benefits have to
          lie in that direction. We've got nothing to threaten him <br/>with--- he's lost his commode seat and his books
          already. That cleans him out.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What would happen if we just told him the situation and offered him something--<br/>- a cell with a
          view. That's what he asked for when he offered to help.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He offered to <i>help</i>, Starling. He didn't offer to snitch. Snitching wouldn't give <br/>him enough
          of a chance to show off. You're doubtful. You favor the truth. Listen, Lecter's <br/>in no hurry. He's
          followed this like it was baseball. We ask him to snitch, he'll wait. He <br/>won't do it right away.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Even for a reward? Something he won't get if Catherine Martin dies?&quot; <br/>&quot;Say we tell him we
          <i>know </i>he's got information and we want him to snitch. He'd <br/></p>
        <p>have the most fun by waiting and acting like he's trying to remember week after week, <br/>getting Senator
          Martin's hopes up and letting Catherine die, and then tormenting the next <br/>mother and the next, getting
          their hopes up, always just about to remember--- that would <br/>be better than having a view. It's the kind
          of thing he lives on. It's his nourishment. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm not sure you get wiser as you get older, Starling, but you do learn to dodge a <br/>certain amount
          of hell. We can dodge some right there.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So Dr. Lecter has to think we're coming to him strictly for theory and insight,&quot; <br/>Starling
          said. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Correct.&quot; <br/>&quot;Why did you tell me? Why didn't you just send me in to ask him that way?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I level with you. You'll do the same when you have a command. Nothing else <br/></p>
        <p>works for long.&quot; <br/>&quot;So there's no mention of the insect in Klaus' throat, no connection between
          Klaus <br/></p>
        <p>and Buffalo Bill.&quot; <br/>&quot;No. You came back to him because you were so impressed that he could
          predict <br/></p>
        <p>Buffalo Bill would start scalping. I'm on the record dismissing him and so is Alan Bloom. <br/>But I'm
          letting you fool with it. You have an offer for some privileges--- stuff that only <br/>somebody as powerful
          as Senator Martin could get for him. He has to believe he should <br/>hurry because the offer ends if
          Catherine dies. The Senator totally loses interest in him if <br/>that happens. And if he fails, it's because
          he's not smart and knowledgeable enough to do <br/>what he said he could do--- it's not because he's holding
          out to spite us.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;<i>Will </i>the Senator lose interest?&quot; <br/>&quot;Better you should be able to say under oath
          that you never knew the answer to <br/></p>
        <p>that question.&quot; <br/>&quot;I see.&quot; So Senator Martin hadn't been told. That took some nerve.
          Clearly, <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was afraid of interference, afraid the Senator might make the mistake of <br/>appealing to Dr.
          Lecter. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;<i>Do </i>you see?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes. How can he be specific enough to steer us to Buffalo Bill
        without showing <br/></p>
        <p>he's got special knowledge? How can he do that with just theory and insight?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't know,
          Starling. He's had a long time to think about it. He's waited through <br/></p>
        <p>six victims.&quot; <br/>The scrambler phone in the van buzzed and blinked with the first of a series of <br/>
        </p>
        <p>calls Crawford had placed with the FBI switchboard. <br/>Over the next twenty minutes he talked to officers
          he knew in the Dutch State <br/></p>
        <p>Police and Royal Marechausee, an <i>Overstelojtnant </i>in the Swedish Technical Police who <br/>had studied
          at Quantico, a personal acquaintance who was assistant to the <i>Rigspolitichef <br/>of </i>the Danish
          governmental police, and he surprised Starling by breaking into French <br/>with the night command desk of the
          Belgian Police Criminelle. Always he stressed the <br/>need for speed in identifying Klaus and his associates.
          Each jurisdiction would already <br/>have the request on its Interpol telex but, with the old-boy network
          buzzing, the request <br/>wouldn't hang from the machine for hours. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling could see that Crawford had chosen the van for its communications--- it <br/>had the new Voice
          Privacy system--- but the job would have been easier from his office. <br/>Here he had to juggle his notebooks
          on the tiny desk in marginal light, and they bounced <br/>each time the tires hit a tar strip. Starling's
          field experience was small, but she knew how <br/>unusual it was for a section chief to be booming along in a
          van on an errand like this. He <br/>could have briefed her over the radio telephone. She was glad he had not.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had the feeling that the quiet and calm in this van, the time allowed for <br/>this mission to
          proceed in an orderly way, had been purchased at a high price. Listening <br/>to Crawford on the phone
          confirmed it. <br/></p>
        <p>He was speaking with the Director at home now. &quot;No sir. Did they rollover for <br/>it?... How long? No
          sir. No. No wire. Tommy, that's my recommendation, I stand on it. I <br/><i>do not </i>want her to wear a
          wire. Dr. Bloom says the same thing. He's fogged in at O'Hare. <br/>He'll come as soon as it clears. Right.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Then Crawford had a cryptic telephone conversation with the night nurse at his <br/>house. When he had
          finished, he looked out the one-way window of the van for perhaps a <br/>minute, his glasses held on his knee
          in the crook of his finger, his face looking naked as <br/>the oncoming lights crawled across it. Then he put
          the glasses on and turned back to <br/>Starling. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;We have Lecter for three days. If we don't get any results, Baltimore sweats him <br/>until the court
          pulls them off.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sweating him didn't work last time. Dr. Lecter doesn't sweat much.&quot; <br/>&quot;What did he give
          them after all that, a paper chicken?&quot; <br/>&quot;A chicken, yes.&quot; The crumpled origami chicken was
          still in Starling's purse. She <br/></p>
        <p>smoothed it out on the little desk and made it peck. <br/>&quot;I don't blame the Baltimore cops. He's their
          prisoner. If Catherine floats, they <br/></p>
        <p>have to be able to tell Senator Martin they tried it all.&quot; <br/>&quot;How is Senator Martin?&quot; <br/>&quot;Game
          but hurting. She's a smart, tough woman with a lot of sense, Starling. <br/></p>
        <p>You'd probably like her.&quot; <br/>&quot;Will Johns Hopkins and Baltimore County homicide keep quiet about
          the bug in <br/></p>
        <p>Klaus' throat? Can we keep it out of the papers?&quot; </p>

        Frederick Chilton, or anybody else at the hospital,&quot; Crawford said. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;If Chilton knows, the world knows. Chilton has to know you're there, but it's simply a <br/>favor
          you're doing Baltimore Homicide, trying to close the Klaus case--- it has nothing to <br/>do with Buffalo
          Bill.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;And I'm doing this late at night?&quot; <br/>&quot;That's the only time I'd give you. I should tell
          you, the business about the bug in <br/></p>
        <p>West Virginia will be in the morning papers. The Cincinnati coroner's office spilled it, so <br/>that's no
          secret anymore. It's an inside detail that Lecter can get from you, and it doesn't <br/>matter, really, as
          long as he doesn't know we found one in Klaus too.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What have we got to trade him?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm working on it,&quot; Crawford said, and turned back
          to his telephones. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 20 <br/> <br/>A</b> big bathroom, all white tile and skylights
          and sleek Italian fixtures standing <br/></p>
        <p>against exposed old brick. An elaborate vanity flanked by tall plants and loaded with <br/>cosmetics, the
          mirror beaded by the steam the shower made. From the shower came <br/>humming in a key too, high for the
          unearthly voice. The song was Fats Walter's &quot;Cash for <br/>Your Trash,&quot; from the musical <i>Ain't
            Misbehavin'.</i> Sometimes the voice broke into the <br/>words: <br/></p>
        <p><br/>&quot;Save up all your old newsPA-PERS, <br/>Save and pile 'em like a high skySCRAPER <br/>DAH DAHDAHDAH
          DAH DAH DAHDAH <br/>DAH DAH...&quot; <br/> <br/>Whenever there were words, a small dog scratched at the
          bathroom door. <br/>In the shower was Jame Gumb, white male, thirty-four, six feet one inch, 205 <br/></p>
        <p>pounds, brown and blue, no distinguishing marks. He pronounces his first name like <br/><i>James </i>without
          the <i>s</i>. Jame. He insists on it. <br/></p>
        <p>After his first rinse, Gumb applied Friction des Bains, rubbing it over his chest <br/>and buttocks with his
          hands and using a dishmop on the parts he did not like to touch. His <br/>legs and feet were a little stubbly,
          but he decided they would do. <br/></p>
        <p>Gumb toweled himself pink and applied a good skin emollient. His full-length <br/>mirror had a shower curtain
          on a bar in front of it. <br/></p>
        <p>Gumb used the dishmop to tuck his penis and testicles back between his legs. He <br/>whipped the shower
          curtain aside and stood before the mirror, hitting a hipshot pose <br/>despite the grinding it caused in his
          private parts. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Do something <i>for </i>me, honey. Do something for me SOON.&quot; He used the upper <br/>range of his
          naturally deep voice, and he believed he was getting better at it. The <br/>hormones he'd taken--- Premarin
          for a while and then diethylstilbestrol, orally--- couldn't <br/>do anything for his voice, but they had
          thinned the hair a little across his slightly budding <br/>breasts. A lot of electrolysis had removed Gumb's
          beard and shaped his hairline into a </p>

      <div><p>widow's peak, but he did not look like a woman. He looked like a man inclined to fight <br/>with his nails
        as well as his fists and feet. <br/></p>
        <p>Whether his behavior was an earnest, inept attempt to swish or a hateful mocking <br/>would be hard to say on
          short acquaintance, and short acquaintances were the only kind <br/>he had. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Whatcha gonna do for meeee?&quot; <br/>The dog scratched on the door at the sound of his voice. Gumb
          put on his robe <br/></p>
        <p>and let the dog in. He picked up the little champagne-colored poodle and kissed her <br/>plump back. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Ye-e-e-e-s. Are you <i>famished, </i>Precious? I am too.&quot; <br/>He switched the little dog from one
          arm to the other to open the bedroom door. <br/></p>
        <p>She squirmed to get down. <br/>&quot;Just a mo', sweetheart.&quot; With his free hand he picked up a Mini-14
          carbine from <br/></p>
        <p>the floor beside the bed and laid it across the pillows. &quot;<i>Now</i>. Now, then. We'll have our <br/>supper
          in a minute.&quot; He put the little dog on the floor while he found his nightclothes. <br/>She trailed him
          eagerly downstairs to the kitchen. <br/></p>
        <p>Jame Gumb took three TV dinners from his microwave oven. There were two <br/>Hungry Man dinners for himself
          and one Lean Cuisine for the poodle. <br/></p>
        <p>The poodle greedily ate her entr&#233;e and the dessert, leaving the vegetable. Jame <br/>Gumb left only the
          bones on his two trays. <br/></p>
        <p>He let the little dog out the back door and, clutching his robe closed against the <br/>chill, he watched her
          squat in the narrow strip of light from the doorway. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You haven't done Number Two-ooo. All right, I won't watch.&quot; But he took a sly <br/>peek between
          his fingers. &quot;Oh, <i>super</i>, you little baggage, aren't you a perfect lady? Come <br/>on, let's go to
          bed.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb liked to go to bed. He did it several times a night. He liked to get up <br/>too, and sit in one or
          another of his many rooms without turning on the light, or work for <br/>a little while in the night, when he
          was hot with something creative. <br/></p>
        <p>He started to turn out the kitchen light, but paused, his lips in a judicious spout as <br/>he considered the
          litter of supper. He gathered up the three TV trays and wiped off the <br/>table. <br/></p>
        <p>A switch at the head of the stairs turned on the lights in the basement. Jame Gumb <br/>started down,
          carrying the trays. The little dog cried in the kitchen and nosed open the <br/>door behind him. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;All right, Silly Billy.&quot; He scooped up the poodle and carried her down. She <br/>wriggled and
          nosed at the trays in his other hand. &quot;No you don't, you've had enough.&quot; He <br/>put her down and
          she followed close beside him through the rambling, multilevel <br/>basement. <br/></p>
        <p>In a basement room directly beneath the kitchen was a well, long dry. Its stone <br/>rim, reinforced with
          modern well rings and cement, rose two feet above the sandy floor. <br/>The original wooden safety cover, too
          heavy for a child to lift, was still in place. There <br/>was a trap in the lid big enough to lower a bucket
          through. The trap was open and Jame <br/>Gumb scraped his trays and the dog's tray into it. <br/></p>
        <p>The bones and bits of vegetable winked out of sight into the absolute blackness of <br/>the well. The little
          dog sat up and begged. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, no, all gone,&quot; Gumb said. &quot;You're too fat as it is.&quot; </p>

      <div><p>He climbed the basement stairs, whispering &quot;Fatty Bread, Fatty Bread&quot; to his little <br/>dog. He
        gave no sign if he heard the cry, still fairly strong and sane, that echoed up from <br/>the black hole: <br/>
      </p>
        <p><i>&quot;PLEEASE.&quot; <br/></i> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 21 <br/> <br/>C</b>larice Starling entered the
          Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane at <br/></p>
        <p>a little after 10:00 P.M. She was alone. Starling had hoped Dr. Frederick Chilton wouldn't <br/>be there, but
          he was waiting for her in his office. <br/></p>
        <p>Chilton wore an English-cut sportcoat in windowpane check. The double vent and <br/>skirts gave it a peplum
          effect, Starling thought. She hoped to God he hadn't dressed for <br/>her. <br/></p>
        <p>The room was bare in front of his desk, except for a straight chair screwed to the <br/>floor. Starling stood
          beside it while her greeting hung in the air. She could smell the cold, <br/>rank pipes in the rack beside
          Chilton's humidor. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Chilton finished examining his collection of Franklin Mint locomotives and <br/>turned to her. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Would you like a cup of decaf?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, thanks. I'm sorry to interrupt your evening.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;You're still trying to find out something about that head business,&quot; Dr. Chilton <br/></p>
        <p>said. <br/>&quot;Yes. The Baltimore district attorney's office told me they'd made the <br/></p>
        <p>arrangements with you, Doctor.&quot; <br/>&quot;Oh yes. I work <i>very </i>closely with the authorities here,
          Miss Starling. Are,you <br/></p>
        <p>doing an article or a thesis, by the way?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Have you ever been published
          in any of the professional journals?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, I never have. This is just an errand the U.S.
          Attorney's office asked me to do <br/></p>
        <p>for Baltimore County Homicide. We left them with an open case and we're just helping <br/>them tidy up the
          loose ends.&quot; Starling found her distaste for Chilton made the lying <br/>easier. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Are you wired, Miss Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Am I---&quot; <br/>&quot;Are you wearing a microphone
          device to record what Dr. Lecter says? The <br/></p>
        <p>police term is 'wired,' I'm sure you've heard it.&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>Dr. Chilton took a small
          Pearlcorder from his desk and popped a cassette into it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Then put this in your purse. I'll have it transcribed and forward you a copy. You can use <br/>it to
          augment your notes.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, I can't do that, Dr. Chilton.&quot; <br/>&quot;Why on earth not? The Baltimore authorities have
          asked me all along for my <br/></p>
        <p>analysis of anything Lecter says about this Klaus business.&quot; <br/><i>Get around Chilton if you can, </i>Crawford
          told her. <i>We can step on him in a minute <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>with a court order, but Lecter will smell it. He can see through Chilton like a CAT scan. </i></p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;The U.S. Attorney thought we'd try an informal approach first. If I recorded Dr. <br/>Lecter without
        his knowledge, and he found out, it would really, it would be the end of <br/>any kind of working atmosphere we
        had. I'm sure you'd agree with that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How would he find out?&quot; <br/><i>He'd read it in the newspaper with everything else you know, you
          fucking jerk. <br/></i></p>
        <p>She didn't answer. &quot;If this should go anywhere and he has to depose, you'd be the first <br/>one to see
          the material and I'm sure you'd be invited to serve as expert witness. We're just <br/>trying to get a lead
          out of him now.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Do you know why he talks to you, Miss Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, Dr. Chilton.&quot; <br/>He looked
          at each item in the claque of certificates and diplomas on the walls <br/></p>
        <p>behind his desk as though he were conducting a poll. Now a slow turn to Starling. &quot;Do <br/>you
          <i>really </i>feel you know what you're doing?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sure I do.&quot; <i>Lot of ''do's'' there. </i>Starling's legs were shaky from too much <br/>exercise.
          She didn't want to fight with Chilton. She had to have something left when she <br/>got to Lecter. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What you're doing is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and <br/>refusing to share
          information with me.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm acting on my instructions, Dr. Chilton. I have the U.S. Attorney's night <br/>number here. Now
          please, either discuss it with him or let me do my job.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm not a turnkey here, Miss Starling. I don't come running down here at night <br/>just to let people
          in and out. I had a ticket to <i>Holiday on Ice.&quot; <br/></i></p>
        <p>He realized he'd said <i>a </i>ticket. In that instant Starling saw his life, and he knew it. <br/>She saw
          his bleak refrigerator, the crumbs on the TV tray where he ate alone, the <br/></p>
        <p>still piles his things stayed in for months until he moved them--- she felt the ache of his <br/>whole
          yellow-smiling Sen-Sen lonesome life--- and switchblade-quick she knew not to <br/>spare him, not to talk on
          or look away. She stared into his face, and with the smallest tilt <br/>of her head, she gave him her good
          looks and bored her knowledge in, speared him with <br/>it, knowing he couldn't stand for the conversation to
          go on. <br/></p>
        <p>He sent her with an orderly named Alonzo. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 22 <br/> <br/>D</b>escending through
          the asylum with Alonzo toward the final keep, Starling <br/></p>
        <p>managed to shut out much of the slammings and the screaming, though she felt them <br/>shiver the air against
          her skin. Pressure built on her as though she sank through water, <br/>down and down. <br/></p>
        <p>The proximity of madmen--- the thought of Catherine Martin bound and alone, <br/>with one of them snuffling
          her, patting his pockets for his tools--- braced Starling for her <br/>job. But she needed more than
          resolution. She needed to be calm, to be still, to be the <br/>keenest instrument. She had to use patience in
          the face of the awful need to hurry. If Dr. <br/>Lecter knew the answer, she'd have to find it down among the
          tendrils of his thought. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling found she thought of Catherine Baker Martin as the child she'd seen in <br/>the film on the news,
          the little girl in the sailboat. <br/></p>
        <p>Alonzo pushed the buzzer at the last heavy door. </p>

      <div><p>&quot;Teach us to care and not to care, teach us to be still.&quot; <br/>&quot;Pardon me?&quot; Alonzo
        said, and Starling realized she had spoken aloud. <br/>He left her with the big orderly who opened the door. As
        Alonzo turned away, she <br/></p>
        <p>saw him cross himself. <br/>&quot;Welcome back,&quot; the orderly said, and shot the bolts home behind her.
          <br/>&quot;Hello, Barney.&quot; <br/>A paperback book was wrapped around Barney's massive index finger as he
          held <br/></p>
        <p>his place. It was Jane Austen's <i>Sense and Sensibility; </i>Starling was set to notice <br/>everything.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How do you want the lights?&quot; he said. <br/>The corridor between the cells was dim. Near the far
          end she could see bright <br/></p>
        <p>light from the last cell shining on the corridor floor. <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter's awake.&quot; <br/>&quot;At
          night, always--- even when his lights are off.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let's leave them like they are.&quot; <br/>&quot;Stay
          in the middle going down, don't touch the bars, right?&quot; <br/>&quot;I want to shut that TV off.&quot; The
          television had been moved. It was at the far end, <br/></p>
        <p>facing up the center of the corridor. Some inmates could see it by leaning their heads <br/>against the bars.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sure, turn the sound off, but leave the picture if you don't mind. Some of 'em like <br/>to look at it.
          The chair's right there if you want it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling went down the dim corridor alone. She did not look into the cells on <br/>either side. Her footfalls
          seemed loud to her. The only other sounds were wet snoring <br/>from one cell, maybe two, and a low chuckle
          from another. <br/></p>
        <p>The late Miggs' cell had a new occupant. She could see long legs outstretched on <br/>the floor, the top of a
          head resting against the bars. She looked as she passed. A man sat <br/>on the cell floor in a litter of
          shredded construction paper. His face was vacant. The <br/>television was reflected in his eyes and a shiny
          thread of spit connected the corner of his <br/>mouth and his shoulder. <br/></p>
        <p>She didn't want to look into Dr. Lecter's cell until she was sure he had seen her. <br/>She passed it,
          feeling itchy between the shoulders, went to the television and turned off <br/>the sound. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter wore the white asylum pajamas in his white cell. The only colors in the <br/>cell were his hair
          and eyes and his red mouth, in a face so long out of the sun it leached <br/>into the surrounding whiteness;
          his features seemed suspended above the collar of his <br/>shirt. He sat at his table behind the nylon net
          that kept him back from the bars. He was <br/>sketching on butcher paper, using his hand for a model. As she
          watched, he turned his <br/>hand over and, flexing his finger's to great tension, drew the inside of the
          forearm. He <br/>used his little finger as a shading stump to modify a charcoal line. <br/></p>
        <p>She came a little closer to the bars, and he looked up. For Starling every shadow <br/>in the cell flew into
          his eyes and widow's peak. . - <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Good evening, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/>The tip of his tongue appeared, with his lips equally red. It
          touched his upper lip <br/></p>
        <p>in the exact center and went back in again. <br/>&quot;Clarice.&quot; <br/>She heard the slight metallic rasp
          beneath his voice and wondered how long it had </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>been since last he spoke. Beats of silence... <br/>&quot;You're up late for a school night,&quot; he said.
        <br/>&quot;This is night school,&quot; she said, wishing her voice were stronger. &quot;Yesterday I <br/></p>
        <p>was in West Virginia---&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you hurt yourself?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, I---&quot; <br/>&quot;You
          have on a fresh Band-Aid, Clarice.&quot; <br/>Then she remembered. &quot;I got a scrape on the side of the
          pool, swimming today.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The Band-Aid was out of sight, on her calf beneath her trousers. He must smell it. &quot;I was <br/>in West
          Virginia yesterday. They found a body over there, Buffalo Bill's latest.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Not quite his <i>latest</i>, Clarice.&quot; <br/>&quot;His next-to-latest.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;She was scalped. Just as you said she would be.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you mind, if I go on sketching
          while we talk?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, please.&quot; <br/>&quot;You viewed the remains?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Had you seen his earlier efforts?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. Only pictures.&quot; <br/>&quot;How did you
          feel?&quot; <br/>&quot;Apprehensive. Then I was busy.&quot; <br/>&quot;And after?&quot; <br/>&quot;Shaken.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Could you function all right?&quot; Dr. Lecter rubbed his charcoal on the edge of his <br/></p>
        <p>butcher paper to refine the point. <br/>&quot;Very well. I functioned very well.&quot; <br/>&quot;For Jack
          Crawford? Or does he still make house calls?&quot; <br/>&quot;He was there.&quot; <br/>&quot;Indulge me a
          moment, Clarice. Would you let your head hang forward, just let it <br/></p>
        <p>hang forward as though you were asleep. A second more. Thank you, I've got it now. <br/>Have a seat, if you
          like. You had told Jack Crawford what I said before they found her?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes. He pretty much pooh-poohed it.&quot; <br/>&quot;And after he saw the body in West Virginia? <br/>&quot;He
          talked to his main authority, from the University of---&quot; <br/>&quot;Alan Bloom.&quot; <br/>&quot;That's
          right. Dr.. Bloom said Buffalo Bill was fulfilling a persona the newspapers <br/></p>
        <p>created, the Buffalo Bill scalp-taking business the tabloids were playing with. Dr. Bloom <br/>said anybody
          could see that was coming.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Bloom saw that coming?&quot; <br/>&quot;He said he did.&quot; <br/>&quot;He saw it coming, but he
          kept it to himself. I see. What do you think, Clarice?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm not sure.&quot; <br/>&quot;You
          have some psychology, some forensics. Where the two flow together you <br/></p>
        <p>fish, don't you? Catching anything, Clarice?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's pretty slow so far.&quot; </p>

        <p>hives.&quot; Dr. Lecter finished sketching his left hand with his right, switched the charcoal <br/>and began
          to sketch his right with his left, and just as well. &quot;Do you mean Dr. Bloom's <br/>book?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;You looked me up in it, didn't you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;How
          did he describe me?&quot; <br/>&quot;A pure sociopath.&quot; <br/>&quot;Would you say Dr. Bloom is always
          right?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm still waiting for the shallowness of affect.&quot; <br/>Dr. Lecter's smile
          revealed his small white teeth. &quot;We have experts at every hand, <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice. Dr. Chilton says Sammie, behind you there, is a hebephrenic schizoid and <br/>irretrievably lost. He
          put Sammie in Miggs' old cell, because he thinks Sammie's said <br/>bye-bye. Do you know how hebephrenics
          usually go? Don't worry, he won't hear you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;They're the hardest to treat,&quot; she said. &quot;Usually they go into terminal withdrawal <br/>and
          personality disintegration.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter took something from between his sheets of butcher paper and put it in <br/>the sliding food
          carrier. Starling pulled it through. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Only yesterday Sammie sent that across with my supper,&quot; he said. <br/>It was a scrap of
          construction paper with writing in crayon. <br/>Starling read: <br/> <br/>I WAN TOO GO TO JESA <br/>I WAN TOO
          GO WIV CRIEZ <br/>I CAN GO WIV JESA <br/>EF I AC RELL NIZE <br/> <br/>SAMMIE <br/> <br/>Starling looked back
          over her right shoulder. Sammie sat vacant-faced against the <br/></p>
        <p>wall of his cell, his head leaning against the bars. <br/>&quot;Would you read it aloud? He won't hear you.&quot;
          <br/>Starling began. &quot; 'I want to go to Jesus, I want to go with Christ, I can go with <br/></p>
        <p>Jesus if I act real nice.' &quot; <br/>&quot;No, no. Get a more assertive 'Pease porridge hot' quality into
          it. The meter varies <br/></p>
        <p>but the intensity is the same.&quot; Lecter clapped time softly, &quot;Pease porridge <i>in </i>the pot, <i>nine
          <br/>days old.</i> Intensely, you see. Fervently. 'I <i>wan </i>to go to Jesa, I <i>wan </i>to go wiv Criez.'
          &quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I see,&quot; Starling said, putting the paper back in the carrier. <br/>&quot;No, you don't see
          anything at all.&quot; Dr. Lecter bounded to his feet, his tithe body <br/></p>
        <p>suddenly grotesque, bent in a gnomish squat and he was bouncing, clapping time, his <br/>voice ringing like
          sonar, &quot;I <i>wan </i>to go to Jesa---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Sammie's voice boomed behind her sadden as a leopard's cough, louder than a <br/>howler monkey, Sammy up and
          mashing his face into the bars, livid and straining, the </p>

        <i>CRIEZ</i> <br/>I CAN <i>GO </i>WIV JESA <br/><i>EF I AC RELL NIIIZE.&quot; <br/></i> <br/>Silence. Starling
        found that she was standing and her folding chair was over <br/></p>
        <p>backwards. Her papers had spilled from her lap. <br/>&quot;Please,&quot; Dr. Lecter said, erect and graceful
          as a dancer once again, inviting her to <br/></p>
        <p>sit. He dropped easily into his seat and rested his chin on his hand. &quot;You don't see at all,&quot; <br/>he
          said again. &quot;Sammie is intensely religious. He's simply disappointed because Jesus is <br/>so late. May I
          tell Clarice why you're here, Sammie?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Sammie grabbed the lower part of his face and halted its movement. <br/>&quot;Please?&quot; Dr. Lecter said.
          <br/>&quot;Eaaah,&quot; Sammie said between his fingers. <br/>&quot;Sammie put his mother's head in the
          collection plate at the Highway Baptist <br/></p>
        <p>Church in Trune. They were singing 'Give of Your Best to the Master' and it was the <br/>nicest thing he had.&quot;
          Lecter spoke over her shoulder. &quot;Thank you, Sammie. It's perfectly <br/>all right. Watch television.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>The tall man subsided to the floor with his head against the bars, just as before, <br/>the images from the
          television worming on his pupils, three streaks of silver on his face <br/>now, spit and tears. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Now. See if you can apply yourself to his problem and perhaps I'll apply myself <br/>to yours. Quid pro
          quo. He's not listening.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had to bear down hard. &quot;The verse changes from 'go to Jesus' to 'go with <br/>Christ,' &quot;
          she said. &quot;That's a reasoned sequence: going to, arriving at, going with.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes. It's a linear progression. I'm particularly pleased that he knows 'Jesa' and <br/>'Criez' are the
          same. That's progress. The idea of a single Godhead also being a Trinity is <br/>hard to reconcile,
          particularly for Sammie, who's not positive how many people he is <br/>himself. Eldridge Cleaver gives us the
          parable of the 3-in-One Oil, and we find that <br/>useful.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He sees a causal relationship between his behavior and his aims, that's structured <br/>thinking,&quot;
          Starling said. &quot;So is the management of a rhyme. He's not blunted--- he's <br/>crying. You believe he's a
          catatonic schizoid?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes. Can you smell his sweat? That peculiar goatish odor is trans-3-methyl-2 <br/>hexenoic acid.
          Remember it, it's the smell of schizophrenia.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;And you believe he's treatable?&quot; <br/>&quot;Particularly now, when he's coming out of a stuporous
          phase. How his cheeks <br/></p>
        <p>shine!&quot; <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter, why do you say Buffalo Bill's not a sadist?&quot; <br/>&quot;Because the
          newspapers have reported the bodies had ligature marks on the <br/></p>
        <p>wrists, but not the ankles. Did you see any on the person's ankles in West Virginia?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot;

        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter, we have some extraordinary circumstances here and some unusual <br/>opportunities.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;For whom?&quot; <br/>&quot;For you, if we save this one. Did you see Senator Martin on television?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Yes, I saw the news.&quot; <br/>&quot;What did you think of the statement?&quot; <br/>&quot;Misguided
          but harmless. She's badly advised.&quot; <br/>&quot;She's very powerful, Senator Martin. And determined.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Let's have it.&quot; <br/>&quot;I think you have extraordinary insight. Senator Martin has
          indicated that if you <br/></p>
        <p>help us get Catherine Baker Martin back alive and unharmed, she'll help you get <br/>transferred to a federal
          institution, and if there's a view available, you'll get it. You may <br/>also be asked to review written
          psychiatric evaluations of incoming patients--- a job, in <br/>other words. No relaxing of security
          restrictions.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I don't believe that, Clarice.&quot; <br/>&quot;You should.&quot; <br/>&quot;Oh, I believe <i>you</i>.
          But there are more things you don't know about human <br/></p>
        <p>behavior than how a proper flaying is conducted. Would you say that for a United States <br/>Senator, you're
          an odd choice of messenger?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I was <i>your </i>choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer <br/>someone else now?
          Or maybe you don't think you could help.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That is both impudent and untrue, Clarice. I don't believe Jack Crawford would <br/>allow any
          compensation ever to reach me... Possibly I'll tell you one thing you can tell the <br/>Senator, but I operate
          strictly COD. Maybe I'll trade for a piece of information about you. <br/>Yes or no?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Let's hear the question.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes or no? Catherine's waiting, isn't she? Listening to the
          whetstone? What do <br/></p>
        <p>you think she'd ask you to do?&quot; <br/>&quot;Let's hear the question.&quot; <br/>&quot;What's your worst
          memory of childhood?&quot; <br/>Starling took a deep breath. <br/>&quot;Quicker than that,&quot; Dr. Lecter
          said. &quot;I'm not interested in your worst <i>invention.&quot; <br/></i>&quot;The death of my father,&quot;
          Starling said. <br/>&quot;Tell me.&quot; <br/>&quot;He was a town marshal. One night he surprised two
          burglars, addicts, coming out <br/></p>
        <p>of the back of the drugstore. As he was getting out of his pickup he short-shucked a pump <br/>shotgun and
          they shot him.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Short-shucked?&quot; <br/>&quot;He didn't work the slide fully. It was an old pump gun, a Remington
          870, and the <br/></p>
        <p>shell hung up in the shell carrier. When it happens the gun won't shoot and you have to <br/>take it down to
          clear it. I think he must have hit the slide on the door getting out.&quot; </p>

        from the hospital.&quot; <br/>Starling closed her eyes. &quot;A neighbor came, an older woman, a single lady,
        and <br/></p>
        <p>she recited the end of &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; to him. I guess that was all she knew to say. That's it. <br/>We've

        <p>&quot;Yes we have. You've been very frank, Clarice. I always know. I think it would be <br/>quite something

          had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat--- that hasn't been made <br/></p>
        <p>public.&quot; <br/>&quot;Was it a butterfly?&quot; <br/>Her breath stopped for a moment. She hoped he didn't

          Buffalo Bill wants Catherine Baker Martin <br/></p>
        <p>for, and then good night. This is my last word under the current terms. You can tell the <br/>Senator what he
          wants with Catherine and she can come up with a more interesting offer <br/>for me... or she can wait until
          Catherine bobs to the surface and see that I was right.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What does he want her for, Dr. Lecter?&quot; <br/>&quot;He wants a vest with tits on it,&quot; Dr.
          Lecter said. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 23 <br/> <br/>C</b>atherine Baker Martin lay seventeen feet below the
          cellar floor. The darkness <br/></p>
        <p>was loud with her breathing, loud with her heart. Sometimes the fear stood on her chest <br/>the way a
          trapper kills a fox. Sometimes she could think: she knew she was kidnapped, <br/>but she didn't know by whom.
          She knew she wasn't dreaming; in the absolute dark she <br/>could hear the tiny clicks her eyes made when she
          blinked. <br/></p>
        <p>She was better now than when she first regained consciousness. Much of the <br/>awful vertigo was gone, and
          she knew there was enough air. She could tell <i>down </i>from <i>up </i></p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>and she had some sense of her body's position. <br/>Her shoulder, hip, and knee hurt from being pressed
        against the cement floor <br/></p>
        <p>where she lay. That side was <i>down</i>. <i>Up </i>was the rough futon she had crawled beneath <br/>during
          the last interval of blazing, blinding light. The throbbing in her head had subsided <br/>now. and her only
          real pain was in the fingers of her left hand. The ring finger was <br/>broken, she knew. <br/></p>
        <p>She wore a quilted jumpsuit that was strange to her. It was clean and smelled of <br/>fabric softener. The
          floor was clean too, except for the chicken bones and bits of <br/>vegetable her captor had raked into the
          hole. The only other objects with her were the <br/>futon and a plastic sanitation bucket with a thin string
          tied to the handle. It felt like cotton <br/>kitchen string and it led up into the darkness as far as she
          could reach. <br/></p>
        <p>Catherine Martin was free to move around, but there was no place to go. The floor <br/>she lay on was oval,
          about eight by ten feet, with a small drain in the center. It was the <br/>bottom of a deep covered pit. The
          smooth cement walls sloped gently inward as they <br/>rose. <br/></p>
        <p>Sounds from above now or was it her heart? Sounds from above. Sounds came <br/>clearly to her from overhead.
          The oubliette that held her was in the part of the basement <br/>directly beneath the kitchen. Footsteps now
          across the kitchen floor, and running water. <br/>The scratching of dog claws on linoleum. Nothing then until
          a weak disc of yellow light <br/>through the open trap above as the basement lights came on. Then blazing
          light in the pit, <br/>and this time she sat up into the light, the futon across her legs, determined to look
          <br/>around, trying to peer through her fingers as her eyes adjusted, her shadow swaying <br/>around her as a
          floodlamp lowered into the pit swung on its cord high above. <br/></p>
        <p>She flinched as her toilet bucket moved, lifted, swayed upward on its flimsy <br/>string, twisting slowly as
          it rose toward the light. She tried to swallow down her fear, got <br/>too much air with it, but managed to
          speak. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;My family will pay,&quot; she said. &quot;Cash. My mother will pay it now, no questions <br/>asked.
          This is her private--- <i>oh!&quot; </i>a flapping shadow down on her, only a towel. &quot;This is <br/>her
          private number. It's 202-&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Wash yourself.&quot; <br/>It was the same unearthly voice she'd heard talking to the dog. <br/>Another
          bucket coming down on a thin cord. She smelled hot, soapy water. <br/>&quot;Take it off and wash yourself all
          over, or you'll get the hose.&quot; And an aside to the <br/></p>
        <p>dog as the voice faded, &quot;Yes it will get the hose, won't it, Darlingheart, yes it <i>will!&quot;
          <br/></i>Catherine Martin heard the footsteps and the claws on the floor above the <br/></p>
        <p>basement. The double vision she'd had the first time the lights went on was gone now. <br/>She could see. How
          high was the top, was the floodlight on a strong cord? Could she <br/>snag it with the jumpsuit, catch
          something with the towel. Do <i>something </i>hell. The walls <br/>were so smooth, a smooth tube upward. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>A crack in the cement a foot above her reach, the only blemish she could see. She <br/>rolled the futon as
          tightly as she could and tied the roll with the towel. Standing on it, <br/>wobbly, reaching for the crack,
          she got her fingernails in it for balance and peered up into <br/>the light. Squinting into the glare. It's a
          floodlight with a shade, hanging just a foot down <br/>into the pit, almost ten feet above her upstretched
          hand, it might as well be the moon, and <br/>he was coming, the futon was wobbling, she scrabbling at the
          crack in the wall for <br/>balance, hopping down, something, a flake falling past her face. </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Something coming down past the light, a hose. A single spatter of icy water, a <br/>threat. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Wash yourself. All over.&quot; <br/>There was a washcloth in the bucket and floating in the water was a
          plastic bottle <br/></p>
        <p>of an expensive foreign skin emollient. <br/>She did it, goosebumps on her arms and thighs, nipples sore and
          shriveled in the <br/></p>
        <p>cool air, she squatted beside the bucket of warm water as close to the wall as she could <br/>get and washed.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Now dry off and rub the cream all over. Rub it all over.&quot; <br/>The cream was warm from the bath
          water. Its moisture made the jumpsuit stick to <br/></p>
        <p>her skin. <br/>&quot;Now pick up your litter and wash the floor.&quot; <br/>She did that too, gathering the
          chicken bones and picking up the English peas. She <br/></p>
        <p>put them in the bucket, and dabbed the little spots of grease on the cement. Something <br/>else here, near
          the wall. The flake that had fluttered down from the crack above. It was a <br/>human fingernail, covered with
          glitter polish and torn off far back in the quick. <br/></p>
        <p>The bucket was pulled aloft. <br/>&quot;My mother will pay,&quot; Catherine Martin said. &quot;No questions
          asked. She'll pay <br/></p>
        <p>enough for you all to be rich. If it's a cause, Iran or Palestine, or Black Liberation, she'll <br/>give the
          money for that. All you have to do---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The lights went out. Sudden and total darkness. <br/>She flinched and went &quot;Uhhhhhh!&quot; when her
          sanitation bucket settled beside her <br/></p>
        <p>on its string. She sat on the futon, her mind racing. She believed now that her captor was <br/>alone, that
          he was a white American. She'd tried to give the impression she had no idea <br/>what he was, what color or
          how many, that her memory of the parking lot was wiped out <br/>by the blows on her head. She hoped that he
          believed he could safely let her go. Her mind <br/>was working, working, and at last it worked too well. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>The fingernail, someone else was here. A woman, a girl was here. Where was she <br/>now? What did he do to
          her? <br/></p>
        <p>Except for shock and disorientation, it would not have been so long in coming to <br/>her. As it was, the
          skin emollient did it. Skin. She knew who had her then. The <br/>knowledge fell on her like every scalding
          awful thing on earth and she was screaming, <br/>screaming, under the futon, up and climbing, clawing at the
          wall, screaming until she. <br/>was coughing something warm and salty in her mouth, hands to her face, drying
          sticky on <br/>the backs of her hands and she lay rigid on the futon, arching off the floor from head to <br/>heels,
          her hands clenched in her hair. <br/></p>

        <p>Lecter asked me if the insect in West Virginia was a butterfly. He wouldn't elaborate. He <br/>said Buffalo

        he break it off?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;How soon do you think he'll talk again?&quot; <br/>&quot;I
        think he'd like to do this over the next few days, but I'd rather hit him again <br/></p>
        <p>now, if I can have some kind of urgent offer from the Senator.&quot; <br/>&quot;Urgent is right. We got an ID
          on the girl in West Virginia, Starling. A missing-<br/></p>
        <p>person fingerprint card from Detroit rang the cherries in ID section about a half hour ago. <br/>Kimberly
          Jane Emberg, twenty-two, missing from Detroit since February seventh. We're <br/>canvassing her neighborhood
          for witnesses. The Charlottesville medical examiner says <br/>she died not later than February eleventh, and
          possibly the day before, the tenth.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He only kept her alive three days,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;His period's getting shorter. I
          don't think anybody's surprised.&quot; Crawford's voice <br/></p>
        <p>was even. &quot;He's had Catherine Martin about twenty-six hours. I think if Lecter can <br/>deliver, he'd
          better do it in your next conversation. I'm set up in the Baltimore field office, <br/>the van patched you
          through. I have a room for you in the Hojo two blocks from the <br/>hospital if you need a catnap later on.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He's leery, Mr. Crawford, he's not sure you'd let him have anything good. What <br/>he said about
          Buffalo Bill, he traded for personal information about me. I don't think <br/>there's any textual correlation
          between his questions and the case... Do you want to know <br/>the questions?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;That's why you didn't make me wear a wire, isn't it? You thought it'd be easier
          <br/></p>
        <p>for me, I'd be more likely to tell him stuff and please him if nobody else could hear.&quot; <br/>&quot;Here's
          another possibility for you: What if I trusted your judgment, Starling? <br/></p>
        <p>What if I thought you were my best shot, and I wanted to keep a lot of second-guessers <br/>off your back?
          Would I have you wear a wire then?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No sir.&quot; <i>You're famous for handling agents, aren't you, Mr. Crawfish? </i>&quot;What can <br/>we

        <p>&quot;A couple of things I'm sending over. It'll be there in five minutes, unless you <br/>want to rest a
          little first.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'd rather do it now,&quot; Starling said. &quot;Tell them to ask for Alonzo. Tell Alonzo I'll <br/>meet
          him in the corridor outside Section 8.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Five minutes,&quot; Crawford said. <br/>Starling walked up and down the linoleum of the shabby lounge
          far underground. <br/></p>
        <p>She was the only brightness in the room. <br/>We rarely get to prepare ourselves in meadows or on graveled
          walks; we do it on <br/></p>
        <p>short notice in places without windows, hospital corridors, rooms like this lounge with its <br/>cracked
          plastic sofa and Cinzano ashtrays, where the caf&#233; curtains cover blank concrete. <br/>In rooms like this,
          with so little time, we prepare our gestures, get them by heart so we <br/>can do them when we're frightened
          in the face of Doom. Starling was old enough to know <br/>that; she didn't let the room affect her. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling walked up and down. She gestured to the air. &quot;Hold on, girl,&quot; she said <br/>aloud. She
          said it to Catherine Martin and she said it to herself. &quot;We're better than this <br/>room. We're better
          than this fucking place,&quot; she said aloud. &quot;We're better than wherever <br/>he's got you. Help me.
          Help me. Help me.&quot; She thought for an instant of her late parents. </p>

      <div><p>She wondered if they would be ashamed of her now--- just that question, not its <br/>pertinence, no
        qualifications--- the way we always ask it. The answer was no, they would <br/>not be ashamed of her. <br/></p>
        <p>She washed her face and went out into the hall. <br/>The orderly Alonzo was in the corridor with a sealed
          package from Crawford. It <br/></p>
        <p>contained a map and instructions. She read them quickly by the corridor light and pushed <br/>the button for
          Barney to let her in. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 25 <br/> <br/>D</b>r. Lecter was at his table, examining his correspondence. Starling
          found it easier <br/></p>
        <p>to approach the cage when he wasn't looking at her. <br/>&quot;Doctor.&quot; <br/>He held up a finger for
          silence. When he had finished reading his letter, he sat <br/></p>
        <p>musing, the thumb of his six-fingered hand beneath his chin, his index finger beside his <br/>nose. &quot;What
          do you make of this?&quot; he said, putting the document into the food carrier. <br/></p>
        <p>It was a letter from the U.S. Patent Office. <br/>&quot;This is about my crucifixion watch,&quot; Dr. Lecter
          said. &quot;They won't give me a <br/></p>
        <p>patent, but they advise me to copyright the face. Look here.&quot; He put a drawing the size of <br/>a dinner
          napkin in the carrier and Starling pulled it through. &quot;You may have noticed that <br/>in most
          crucifixions the hands point to, say, a quarter to three, or ten till two at the <br/>earliest, while the feet
          are at six. On this watch face, Jesus is on the cross, as you see <br/>there, and the arms revolve to indicate
          the time, just like the arms on the popular Disney <br/>watches. The feet remain at six and at the top a small
          second hand revolves in the halo. <br/>What do you think?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The quality of the anatomical sketching was very good. The head was hers. <br/>&quot;You'll lose a lot of
          detail when it's reduced to watch size,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;True, unfortunately, but think of the
          clocks. Do you think this is safe without a <br/></p>
        <p>patent?&quot; <br/>&quot;You'd be buying quartz watch movements--- wouldn't you? and they're already <br/>
        </p>
        <p>under patent. I'm not sure; but I think patents only apply to unique mechanical devices <br/>and copyright
          applies to design.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;But you're not a lawyer, are you? They don't require that in the FBI anymore.&quot; <br/>&quot;I have a
          proposal for you,&quot; Starling said, opening her briefcase. <br/>Barney was coming. She closed the briefcase
          again. She envied Barney' s <br/></p>
        <p>enormous calm. His eyes read negative for dope and there was considerable intelligence <br/>behind them.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Barney said. &quot;If you've got a lot of papers to wrestle, there's a one-<br/>armed

        <p>School , image. Yes or no? <br/>&quot;May we talk now, Dr. Lecter?&quot; <br/>The doctor held up an open
          palm. <br/>&quot;Yes, Barney. Thank you.&quot; <br/>Seated now and Barnet' safely away. <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter,

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;I'll decide that. You spoke to her so soon?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes. She's not holding anything back.
        This is all she's got, so it's not a matter for <br/></p>
        <p>bargaining. This is it, everything, one offer.&quot; She glanced up from her briefcase. <br/>Dr. Lecter,
          murderer of nine, had his fingers steepled beneath his nose and he was <br/></p>

        <p>get the following: transfer to the Veteran's Administration hospital at Oneida Park, New <br/>York, to a cell
          with a view of the woods around the hospital. Maximum security <br/>measures still apply. You'll be asked to
          help evaluate written psychological tests on some <br/>federal inmates, though not necessarily those sharing
          your own institution. You'll do the <br/>evaluations blind. No identities. You'll have reasonable access to
          books.&quot; She glanced up. <br/></p>
        <p>Silence can mock. <br/>&quot;The best thing, the remarkable thing: one week a year, you will leave the
          hospital <br/></p>
        <p>and go here.&quot; She put a map in the food carrier. Dr. Letter did not pull it through. <br/>&quot;Plum

        <p>anything to threaten you with, Dr. Lecter. What I've got is a way for you to see the <br/>daylight.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>She didn't look at him. She -didn't want to match stares now. This was not a <br/>confrontation. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Will Catherine Martin come and talk to me--- only about her captor--- if I decide <br/>to publish? Talk
          <i>exclusively </i>to me?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes. You can take that as a given.&quot; <br/>&quot;How do you know? <i>Given </i>by whom?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll
          bring her myself.&quot; <br/>&quot;If she'll come.&quot; <br/>&quot;We'll have to ask her first, won't we?&quot;
          <br/>He pulled the carrier through. &quot;Plum Island.&quot; <br/>&quot;Look off the tip of Long Island, the
          north finger there.&quot; <br/>&quot;Plum Island. 'The Plum Island Animal Disease Center. (Federal, hoof and
          mouth <br/></p>
        <p>disease research),' it says. Sounds charming.&quot; <br/>&quot;That's just part of the island. It has a nice
          beach and good quarters. The terns nest <br/></p>
        <p>there in the spring.&quot; <br/>&quot;Terns.&quot; Dr. Letter sighed. He cocked his head slightly and touched
          the center of <br/></p>
        <p>his red lip with his red tongue. &quot;If we talk about this, Clarice, I have to have something <br/>on
          account. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, and you tell me.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Go,&quot; Starling said. <br/>She had to wait a full minute before he said, &quot;A caterpillar becomes
          a pupa in a <br/></p>
        <p>chrysalis. Then it emerges; comes out of its secret changing room as the beautiful imago. <br/>Do you know
          what an imago is, Clarice?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;An adult winged insect.&quot; <br/>&quot;But what else?&quot; <br/>She shook her head. </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;It's a term from the dead religion of psychoanalysis. An imago is an image of the <br/>parent buried
        in the unconscious from infancy and bound with infantile affect. The word <br/>comes from the wax portrait busts
        of their ancestors the ancient Romans carried in <br/>funeral processions... Even the phlegmatic Crawford must
        see some significance in the <br/>insect chrysalis.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Nothing to jump on except checking the entomology journals' subscription lists <br/>against known sex
          offenders in the descriptor index.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;First, let's drop Buffalo Bill. It's a misleading term and has nothing to do with the <br/>person you
          want. For convenience we'll call him Billy. I'll give you a precis of what I <br/>think. Ready?&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Ready.&quot; <br/>&quot;The significance of the chrysalis is change. Worm into butterfly, or moth.
          Billy <br/></p>
        <p>thinks he wants to change. He's making himself a girl suit out of real girls. Hence the <br/>large victims---
          he has to have things that fit. The number of victims suggests he may see <br/>it as a series of molts. He's
          doing this in a two-story house, did you find out why two <br/>stories?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;For a while he was hanging them on the stairs.&quot; <br/>&quot;Correct.&quot; <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter,
          there's no correlation that I ever saw between transsexualism and <br/></p>
        <p>violence--- transsexuals are passive types, usually.&quot; <br/>&quot;That's true, Clarice. Sometimes you see
          a tendency to surgical addiction--- <br/></p>
        <p>cosmetically, transsexuals are hard to satisfy--- but that's about all. Billy's not a real <br/>transsexual.
          You're very close, Clarice, to the way you re going to catch him, do you <br/>realize that?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/>&quot;Good. Then you won't mind telling me what happened to you after your
          father's <br/></p>
        <p>death.&quot; <br/>Starling looked at the scarred top of the school desk. <br/>&quot;I don't imagine the
          answer's in your papers, Clarice.&quot; <br/>&quot;My mother kept us together for more than two years.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Doing what?&quot; <br/>&quot;Working as a motel maid in the daytime, cooking at a caf&#233; at
          night.&quot; <br/>&quot;And then?&quot; <br/>&quot;I went to my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Just you?&quot; <br/>&quot;I was the oldest.&quot; <br/>&quot;The town did nothing for your family?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;A check for five hundred dollars.&quot; <br/>&quot;Curious there was no insurance. Clarice, you
          said your father hit the shotgun <br/></p>
        <p>slide on the door of his pickup.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;He didn't have a patrol car?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;It happened at night.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Didn't he have a
          pistol?&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;It happened at night.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Didn't he have a
        pistol?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Clarice, he was working at night, in a pickup truck, armed only
        with a shotgun.... <br/></p>
        <p>Tell me, did he wear a time clock on his belt by any chance? One of those things where <br/>they have keys
          screwed to posts all over town and you have to drive to them and stick <br/>them in your clock? So the town
          fathers know you weren't asleep. Tell me if he wore one, <br/>Clarice.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;He was a night watchman, wasn't he, Clarice, he wasn't a marshal at all. I'll
          know <br/></p>
        <p>if you lie.&quot; <br/>&quot;The job description said night marshal.&quot; <br/>&quot;What happened to it?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;What happened to what?&quot; <br/>&quot;The time clock. What happened to it after your father was
          shot?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't remember.&quot; <br/>&quot;If you do remember, will you tell me?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.
          Wait--- the mayor came to the hospital and asked my mother for the clock <br/></p>
        <p>and the badge.&quot; She hadn't known she knew that. The mayor in his leisure suit and Navy <br/>surplus
          shoes. The cocksucker. &quot;Quid pro quo, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did you think for a second you'd made that up? No, if you'd made it up, it <br/>wouldn't sting. We were
          talking about transsexuals. You said violence and destructive <br/>aberrant behavior are not statistical
          correlatives of transsexualism. True. Do you <br/>remember what we said about anger expressed as lust, and
          lupus presenting as hives? <br/>Billy's not a transsexual, Clarice, but he thinks he is, he tries to be. He's
          tried to be a lot of <br/>things, I expect.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You said that was close to the way we'd catch him.&quot; <br/>&quot;There are three major centers for
          transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the <br/></p>
        <p>University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center. I wouldn't be surprised if he's <br/>applied for sex
          reassignment at one or all of them and been denied.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;On what basis would they reject him, what would show up?&quot; <br/>&quot;You're very quick, Clarice.
          The first reason would be criminal record. That <br/></p>
        <p>disqualifies an applicant, unless the crime is relatively harmless and related to the gender-<br/>identity
          problem. Cross-dressing in public, something like that. If he lied successfully <br/>about a serious criminal
          record, then the personality inventories would get him.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How?&quot; <br/>&quot;You have to know how in order to sieve them, don't you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Why don't you ask Dr. Bloom?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'd rather ask you.&quot; <br/>&quot;What will you
          get out of this, Clarice, a promotion and a raise? What are you, a <br/></p>
        <p>G-9? What do little G-9's get nowadays?&quot; <br/>&quot;A key to the front door, for one thing. How would he
          show up on the <br/></p>
        <p>diagnostics?&quot; </p>

      <div><p>&quot;How did you like Montana, Clarice?&quot; <br/>&quot;Montana's fine.&quot; <br/>&quot;How did you

        <br/>&quot;Worn out from work.&quot; <br/>&quot;Were there other children?'.&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Where

        <br/>&quot;How long were you there?&quot; <br/>&quot;Seven months.&quot; <br/>&quot;How old were you?&quot;
        <br/>&quot;Ten.&quot; <br/>&quot;Where did you go from there?&quot; <br/>&quot;The Lutheran Home in Bozeman.&quot;
        <br/>&quot;Tell me the truth.&quot; <br/>&quot;I am telling you the truth.&quot; <br/>&quot;You're hopping
        around the truth. If you're tired, we could talk toward the end of <br/></p>
        <p>the week. I'm rather bored myself. Or had you rather talk now?&quot; <br/>&quot;Now, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/>&quot;All
          right. A child is sent away from her mother to a ranch in Montana. A sheep <br/></p>
        <p>and horse ranch. Missing the mother, excited by the animals...&quot; Dr. Lecter invited <br/>Starling with
          his open hands. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;It was great. I had my own room with an Indian rug on the floor. They let me <br/>ride a horse--- they
          led me around on this horse--- she couldn't see very well. There was <br/>something wrong with all the horses.
          Lame or sick. Some of them had been raised with <br/>children and they would, you know, nicker at me in the
          mornings when I went out to the <br/>school bus.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;But then?&quot; <br/>&quot;I found something strange in the barn. They had a little tack room out
          there. I <br/></p>
        <p>thought this thing was some kind of old helmet. When I got it down, it was stamped &quot;W. <br/>W. Greener's
          Humane Horse Killer.&quot; It was sort of a bell-shaped metal cap and it had a <br/>place in the top to
          chamber a cartridge. Looked like about a .32.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did they feed out slaughter horses on this ranch, Clarice?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, they did.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did
          they kill them at the ranch?&quot; <br/>&quot;The glue and fertilizer ones they did. You can stack six in a
          truck if they're dead. <br/></p>
        <p>The ones for dog food they hauled away alive.&quot; <br/>&quot;The one you rode around the yard?&quot; <br/>&quot;We
          ran away together.&quot; <br/>&quot;How far did you get?&quot; <br/>&quot;I got about as far as I'm going
          until you break down the diagnostics for me.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you know the procedure for testing male
          applicants for transsexual surgery?&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;It may help if you bring me a copy of the regimen from any of the centers, but
        to <br/></p>
        <p>begin: the battery of tests usually includes Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, House-<br/>Tree-Person,
          Rorschach, Drawing of Self-Concept, Thematic Apperception, MMPI of <br/>course, and a couple of others--- the
          Jenkins, I think, that NYU developed. You need <br/>something you can see quickly, don't you? Don't you,
          Clarice?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That would be the best, something quick.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let's see... our hypothesis is we're looking
          for a male who will test differently <br/></p>
        <p>from the way a true transsexual would test. All right--- on House-Tree-Person, look for <br/>someone who
          didn't draw the female figure first. Male transsexuals almost always draw <br/>the female first and,
          typically, they pay a lot of attention to adornments on the females <br/>they draw. Their male figures are
          simple stereotypes--- there are some notable exceptions <br/>where they draw Mr. America--- but not much in
          between. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Look for a house drawing without the rosy-future embellishments--- no baby <br/>carriage outside, no
          curtains, no flowers in the yard. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You get two kinds of trees with real transsexuals--- flowing, copious willows and <br/>castration
          themes. The trees that are cut off by the edge of the drawing or the edge of the <br/>paper, the castration
          images, are full of life in the drawings of true transsexuals. <br/>Flowering and fruitful stumps. That's an
          important distinction. They're very unlike the <br/>frightened, dead, mutilated trees you see in drawings by
          people with mental disturbances. <br/>That's a good one--- Billy's tree will be frightful. Am I going too
          fast?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/>&quot;On his drawing of himself; a transsexual will almost never draw
          himself naked. <br/></p>
        <p>Don't be misled by a certain amount of paranoid ideation in the TAT cards--- that's fairly <br/>common among
          transsexual subjects who cross-dress a lot; oftentimes they've had bad <br/>experiences with the authorities.
          Shall I summarize?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, I'd like a summary.&quot; <br/>&quot;You should try to obtain a list of people rejected from all
          three gender-<br/></p>
        <p>reassignment centers. Check first the ones rejected for criminal record--- and among <br/>those look hard at
          the burglars. Among those who tried to conceal criminal records, look <br/>for severe childhood disturbances
          associated with violence. Possibly internment in <br/>childhood. Then go to the tests. You're looking for a
          white male, probably under thirty-<br/>five and sizable. He's not a transsexual, Clarice. He just thinks he
          is, and he's puzzled and <br/>angry because they won't help him. That's all I want to say, I think, until I've
          read the <br/>case. You <i>will </i>leave it with me.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;And the pictures.&quot; <br/>&quot;They're included.&quot; <br/>&quot;Then you'd
          better run with what you have, Clarice, and we'll see how you do.&quot; <br/>&quot;I need to know how you---&quot;
          <br/>&quot;No. Don't be grabby or we'll discuss it next week. Come back when you've made <br/></p>
        <p>some progress. Or not. And Clarice?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Next time you'll tell me two
          things. What happened with the horse is one. The <br/></p>
        <p>other thing I wonder is... how do you manage your rage?&quot; <br/>Alonzo came for her. She held her notes

      <div><p>trying to hold it all in her mind. Eager for the outside air, she didn't even glance toward <br/>Chilton's
        office as she hurried out of the hospital. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Chilton's light was on. You could see it under the door. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 26 <br/> <br/>F</b>ar
          beneath the rusty Baltimore dawn, stirrings in the maximum security ward. <br/></p>
        <p>Down where it is never dark the tormented sense beginning day as oysters in a barrel <br/>open to their lost
          tide. God's creatures who cried themselves to sleep stirred to cry again <br/>and the ravers cleared their
          throats. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Hannibal Lecter stood stiffly upright at the end of the corridor, his face a foot <br/>from the wall.
          Heavy canvas webbing bound him tightly to a movers tall hand truck as <br/>though he were a grandfather clock.
          Beneath the webbing he wore a straitjacket and leg <br/>restraints. A hockey mask over his face precluded
          biting; it was as effective as a <br/>mouthpiece, and not so wet for the orderlies to handle. <br/></p>
        <p>Behind Dr. Lecter, a small, round-shouldered orderly mopped Lecter's cage. <br/>Barney supervised the
          thrice-weekly cleaning and searched for contraband at the same <br/>time. Moppers tended to hurry, finding it
          spooky in Dr. Lecter's quarters. Barney checked <br/>behind them. He checked everything and he neglected
          nothing. <br/></p>
        <p>Only Barney supervised the handling of Dr. Lecter, because Barney never forgot <br/>what he was dealing with.
          His two assistants watched taped hockey highlights on <br/>television. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter amused himself--- he has extensive internal resources and can entertain <br/>himself for years at
          a time. His thoughts were no more bound by fear or kindness than <br/>Milton's were by physics. He was free in
          his head. <br/></p>
        <p>His inner world has intense colors and smells, and not much sound. In fact, he had <br/>to strain a bit to
          hear the voice of the late Benjamin Raspail. Dr. Lecter was musing on <br/>how he would give Jame Gumb to
          Clarice Starling, and it was useful to remember <br/>Raspail. Here was the fat flutist on the last day of his
          life, lying on Lecter's therapy <br/>couch, telling him about Jame Gumb: <br/></p>
        <p><i> <br/>&quot;Jame had the most atrocious room imaginable in this San Francisco flophouse, <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>sort of aubergine walls with smears of psychedelic Day-Glo here and there from the <br/>hippie years,
          terribly battered everything. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Jame--- you know, it's actually spelled that way on his birth certificate, that's <br/>where he got
          it and you have to pronounce it 'Jame,' like 'name,' or he gets livid, even <br/>though it was a mistake at
          the hospital--- they were hiring cheap help even then that <br/>couldn t even get a name right. It's even
          worse today, it's worth your life to go </i>in <i>a <br/>hospital. Anyway, here was Jame sitting on his bed
          with his head in his hands in that <br/>awful room, and he'd been fired from the curio store and he'd done the
          bad thing again. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;I'd told him I simply couldn't put up with his behavior, and Klaus had just come <br/>into my life,
          of course. Jame is not really gay, you know, it's just something he picked up <br/>in jail. He's not anything,
          really, just a sort of total lack that he wants to fill, and so <br/>angry. You always felt the room was a
          little emptier when he came in. I mean he </i>killed <br/><i>his grandparents when he was twelve, you'd think
          a person that volatile would have some </i></p>

        <p><i>person. </i>I <i>was gone. He'd gone by the post office and picked up his former employer's <br/>mail,
          hoping there was something he could sell. And there was a package from Malaysia, <br/>or somewhere over there.
          He eagerly opened it up and it was a suitcase full of dead <br/>butterflies, just in there loose. <br/></i>
        </p>
        <p><i>&quot;His boss sent money to postmasters on all those islands and they sent him boxes <br/>and boxes of
          dead butterflies. He set them in Lucite and made the tackiest ornaments <br/>imaginable--- and he had the gall
          to call them </i>objets. <i>The butterflies were useless to <br/>Jame and he dug his hands </i>in <i>them,
          thinking there might be jewelry underneath--- <br/>sometimes they got bracelets from Bali--- and he got
          butterfly powder on his fingers. <br/>Nothing. He sat on the bed with his head in his hands, butterfly colors
          on his hands and <br/>face and he was at the bottom, just as we've all been, and he was crying. He heard a
          little <br/>noise and it was a butterfly in the open suitcase. It was struggling out of a cocoon that <br/>had
          been thrown in with the butterflies and it climbed out. There was dust in the air from <br/>the butterflies
          and dust in the sun from the window--- you know how terribly </i>vivid <i>it all is <br/>when somebody's
          describing it to you stoned. He watched it pump up its wings. It was a <br/>big one, he said. Green. And he
          opened the window and it flew away and he felt so light, <br/>he said, and he knew what to do. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Jame found the little beach house Klaus and I were using, and when I came <br/>home from rehearsal,
          there he was. But I didn't see Klaus. Klaus wasn't there. I said <br/>where's Klaus and he said swimming. I
          knew that was a lie, Klaus never swam, the <br/>Pacific's much too crashy-bangy. And when I opened the
          refrigerator, well, you know <br/>what I found. Klaus's head looking out from behind the orange juice. Jame
          had made <br/>himself an apron too, you know, from Klaus, and he put it on and asked me how I liked <br/>him
          now. l know you must be appalled that I'd ever have anything else to do with Jame--- <br/>he was even more
          unstable when you met him, I think he was just astounded that you <br/>weren't afraid of him.&quot; <br/></i>
        </p>
        <p><i>And then, the last words Raspail ever said: &quot;I wonder why my parents didn't kill <br/>me before I was
          old enough to fool them.&quot; <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>The slender handle of the stiletto wiggled as Raspail's spiked heart tried to keep <br/>beating, and Dr.
          Lecter said, &quot;Looks like a straw down a doodlebug hole, doesn't it?&quot; but <br/>it was too late for
          Raspail to answer. <br/></i></p>
        <p><br/>Dr. Lecter could remember every word, and much more too. Pleasant thoughts to <br/></p>
        <p>pass the time while they cleaned his cell. <br/>Clarice Starling was astute, the doctor mused. She might get
          Jame Gumb with <br/></p>
        <p>what he had told her, but it was a long shot. To get him in time, she would need more <br/>specifics. Dr.
          Lecter felt sure that when he read the details of the crimes, hints would <br/>suggest themselves--- possibly
          having to do with Gumb's job training in the juvenile <br/>correction facility after he killed his
          grandparents. He'd give her Jame Gumb tomorrow, <br/>and make it clear enough, so that even Jack Crawford
          couldn't miss it. Tomorrow should <br/>see it done. <br/></p>
        <p>Behind him, Dr. Lecter heard footsteps and the television was turned off. He felt <br/>the hand truck tilt
          back. Now would begin the long, tedious process of freeing him within <br/>the cell. It was always done the
          same way. First Barney and his helpers laid him gently </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>on his cot, facedown. Then Barney tied his ankles to the bar at the foot of the cot with <br/>towels,
        removed the leg restraints, and, covered by his two helpers armed with Mace and <br/>riot batons, undid the
        buckles on the back of the straitjacket and backed out of the cell, <br/>locking the net and the barred door in
        place, and leaving Dr. Lecter to work his way out <br/>of his bonds. Then the doctor traded the equipment for
        his breakfast. The procedure had <br/>been in effect ever since Dr. Lecter savaged the nurse, and it worked out
        nicely for <br/>everyone. <br/></p>
        <p>Today the process was interrupted. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 27 <br/> <br/>A </b>slight bump as the hand
          truck carrying Dr. Lecter rolled over the threshold of <br/></p>
        <p>the cage. And here was Dr. Chilton, sitting on the cot, looking through Dr. Lecter's <br/>private
          correspondence. Chilton had his tie and coat off. Dr. Lecter could see some kind <br/>of medal hanging from
          his neck. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Stand him up beside the toilet, Barney,&quot; Dr. Chilton said without looking up. <br/>&quot;You and
          the others wait at your station.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Chilton finished reading Dr. Lecter's most recent exchange with the General <br/>Archives of Psychiatry.
          He tossed the letters on the cot and went outside the cell. A glint <br/>from behind the hockey mask as Dr.
          Lecter's eyes tracked him, but Lecter's head didn't <br/>move. <br/></p>
        <p>Chilton went to the school desk in the hall and, bending stiffly, removed a small <br/>listening device from
          beneath the seat. <br/></p>
        <p>He waggled it in front of the eye holes in Dr. Lecter's mask and resumed his seat <br/>on the cot. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I thought she might be looking for a civil rights violation in Miggs' death, so I <br/>listened,&quot;
          Chilton said. &quot;I hadn't heard your voice in years--- I suppose the last time was <br/>when you gave me
          all the misleading answers in my interviews and then ridiculed me in <br/>your <i>Journal </i>articles. It's
          hard to believe an inmate's opinions could count for anything in <br/>the professional community, isn't it?
          But I'm still here. And so are you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Letter said nothing. <br/>&quot;Years of silence, and then Jack Crawford sends down his girl and you just
          went <br/></p>
        <p>to jelly, didn't you? What was it that got you, Hannibal? Was it those good, hard ankles? <br/>The way her
          hair shines? She's glorious, isn't she? Remote and glorious. A winter sunset <br/>of a girl, that's the way I
          think of her. I know it's been some time since you've seen a <br/>winter sunset, but take my word for it.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You only get one more day with her. Then Baltimore Homicide takes over the <br/>interrogation. They're
          screwing a chair to the floor for you in the electroshock therapy <br/>room. The chair has a commode seat for
          your convenience, and for their convenience <br/>when they attach the wires. I won't know a thing. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Do you get it yet? They <i>know, </i>Hannibal. They know that you know exactly who <br/>Buffalo Bill
          is. They think you probably treated him. When I heard Miss Starling ask <br/>about Buffalo Bill, I was
          puzzled. I called a friend at Baltimore Homicide. They found an <br/>insect in Klaus's throat, Hannibal. They
          know Buffalo Bill killed him. Crawford's letting <br/>you think you're smart. I don't think you know how much
          Crawford hates you for cutting </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>up his prot&#233;g&#233;. He's got you now. Do you feel <i>smart </i>now? <br/><i>Dr. Lecter watched
        Chilton's eyes moving over the straps that held on the mask. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>Clearly Chilton wanted to remove it so he could watch Lecter's face. Lecter wondered if <br/>Chilton would
          do it the safe way, from behind. If he did it from the front, he'd have to <br/>reach around Dr. Lecter's
          head, with the blue-veined insides of his forearms close to <br/>Lecter's face. Come, doctor. Come close. No,
          he's decided against it. <br/></i></p>
        <p>&quot;Do you still think you're going someplace with a window? Do you think you'll <br/>walk on the beach and
          see the birds? I don't think so. I called Senator Ruth Martin and <br/>she never heard of any deal with you. I
          had to remind her who you were. She never heard <br/>of Clarice Starling, either. It's a scam. We have to
          expect <i>small, </i>dishonesties in a woman, <br/>but that's a shocker, wouldn't you say? <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;When they get through milking you, Hannibal, Crawford's charging you with <br/>misprision of a felony.
          You'll duck it on M'Naghten, of course, but the judge won't like it. <br/>You sat through six deaths. The
          judge won't take such interest in your welfare anymore. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No window, Hannibal. You'll spend the rest of your life sitting on the floor in a <br/>state
          institution watching the diaper cart go by. Your teeth will go and your strength and <br/>nobody will be
          afraid of you anymore and you'll be out in the ward at someplace like <br/>Flendauer. The young ones will just
          push you around and use you for sex when they feel <br/>like it. All you'll get to read is what you write on
          the wall. You think the court will care? <br/>You've seen the old ones. They cry when they don't like the
          stewed apricots. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Jack Crawford and his fluff. They'll get together openly after his wife dies. He'll <br/>dress younger
          and take up some sport they can enjoy together. They've been intimate ever <br/>since Bella Crawford got sick,
          they're certainly not fooling anybody about that. They'll <br/>get their promotions and they won't think about
          you once a year. Crawford probably <br/>wants to come personally at the end to tell you what <i>you're </i>getting.
          Up the booty. I'm <br/>sure he has a speech all prepared. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Hannibal, he doesn't know you as well as I do. He thought if he asked you for the <br/>information,
          you'd just torment the mother with it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p><i>Quite right too, </i>Dr. Letter reflected. <i>How wise of Jack--- that obtuse Scotch-Irish <br/>mien is
          misleading. His face is all scars if you know how to look. Well, possibly there's <br/>room for a few more.
          <br/></i></p>
        <p>&quot;I know what you're afraid of. It's not pain, or solitude. It's <i>indignity </i>you can't <br/>stand,
          Hannibal, you're like a cat that way. I'm on my honor to look after you, Hannibal, <br/>and I do it. No
          personal considerations have ever entered into our relationship, from my <br/>end. And I'm looking after you
          now. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;There never was a deal for you, with Senator Martin, but there is now. Or there <br/>could be. I've
          been on the phone for hours on your behalf and for the sake of that girl. I'm <br/>going to tell you the first
          condition: you speak only through me. I alone publish a <br/>professional account of this, my successful
          interview with you. You publish nothing. I <br/>have exclusive access to any material from Catherine Martin,
          if she should be saved. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That condition is nonnegotiable. Youll answer me now. Do you accept that <br/>condition?&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter smiled to himself. <br/>&quot;You'd better answer me now or you can answer Baltimore Homicide.
          This is <br/></p>
        <p>what you get: If you identify Buffalo Bill and the girl is found in time, Senator Martin--- <br/>and she'll
          confirm this by telephone--- Senator Martin will have you installed in Brushy </p>

        books. Any outdoor exercise, the details will have to be <br/>worked out, but she's amenable. Name him and you

        <p><i>At Last Dr. Chilton has said something interesting, and he doesn't even know <br/>what it is.</i> Dr.
          Lecter pursed his red lips behind the mask. <i>The custody of police. Police <br/>are not as wise as Barney.
            Police are accustomed to handling criminals. They're inclined <br/>to use leg irons and handcuffs. Handcuffs
            and leg irons open with a handcuff key. Like <br/>mine. <br/></i></p>
        <p>&quot;His first name is Billy,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. &quot;I'll tell the rest to the Senator. In <br/>Tennessee.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 28 <br/> <br/>J</b>ack Crawford declined Dr. Danielson's coffee, but took the cup to
          mix himself <br/></p>
        <p>an Alka-Seltzer at the stainless-steel sink behind the nursing station. Everything was <br/>stainless steel,
          the cup dispenser, the counter, the waste bin, the rims of Dr. Danielson's <br/>spectacles. The bright metal
          suggested the wink of instruments and gave Crawford a <br/>distinct twinge in the area of his inguinal ring.
          <br/></p>
        <p>He and the doctor were alone in the little galley. <br/>&quot;Not without a court order, you don't,&quot; Dr.
          Danielson said again. He was brusque <br/></p>
        <p>this time, to counter the hospitality he'd shown with the coffee. <br/>Danielson was head of the Gender
          Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins and he had <br/></p>
        <p>agreed to meet Crawford at first light, long before morning rounds. &quot;You'll have to show <br/>me a
          separate court order for each specific case and we'll fight every one. What did <br/>Columbus and Minnesota
          tell you--- same thing, am I right?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;The Justice Department's asking them right now. We have to do this fast, Doctor. <br/>If the girl's not
          dead already, he'll kill her soon--- tonight or tomorrow. Then he'll pick the <br/>next one,&quot; Crawford
          said. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;To even mention Buffalo Bill in the same breath with the problems we treat here <br/>is ignorant and
          unfair and dangerous, Mr. Crawford. It makes my hair stand on end. It's <br/>taken years--- we're not through
          yet--- showing the public that transsexuals aren't crazy, <br/>they aren't perverts, they aren't
          <i>queers, </i>whatever that is---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I agree with you---&quot; <br/>&quot;Hold on. The incidence of violence among transsexuals is a lot
          lower than in the <br/></p>
        <p>general population. These are decent people with a real problem--- a famously in-<br/>transigent problem.
          They deserve help and we can give it. I'm not having a witch hunt <br/>here. We've never violated a patient's
          confidence, and we never will. Better start from <br/>there, Mr. Crawford.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>For months now in his private life, Crawford had been cultivating his wife's <br/>doctors and nurses, trying
          to weasel every minute advantage for her. He was pretty sick <br/>of doctors. But this was not his private
          life. This was Baltimore and it was business. Be <br/>nice now. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Then I haven't made myself clear, Doctor. My fault--- it's early, I'm not a </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>morning person. The whole idea is, the man we want is <i>not your patient. </i>It would be <br/>someone
        you <i>refused </i>because you recognized that he was <i>not a transsexual. </i>We're not <br/>flying blind
        here--- I'll show you some specific ways he'd deviate from typical <br/>transsexual patterns in your personality
        inventories. Here's a short list of things your staff <br/>could look for among your rejects.'' <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Danielson rubbed the side of his nose with his finger as he read. He handed <br/>the paper back. &quot;That's
          original, Mr. Crawford. In fact it's extremely bizarre, and that's a <br/>word I don't use very often. May I
          ask who provided you with that piece of... <br/>conjecture?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p><i>I don't think you'd like to know that, Dr. Danielson. </i>&quot;The Behavioral Science <br/>staff,&quot;
          Crawford said, &quot;in consultation with Dr. Alan Bloom at the University of Chi-<br/>cago.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Alan Bloom</i> endorsed that?&quot; <br/>&quot;And we don't just depend on the tests. There's
          another way Buffalo Bill's likely <br/></p>
        <p>to stand out in your records--- he probably tried to conceal a record of criminal violence, <br/>or falsified
          other background material. Show me the ones you turned away, Doctor.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Danielson was shaking his head the whole time. &quot;Examination and interview <br/>materials are
          confidential.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Danielson, how can fraud and misrepresentation be confidential? How does a <br/>criminal's real
          name and real background fall under the doctor-patient relationship when <br/>he never told it to you, you had
          to find it out for yourself? I know how thorough Johns <br/>Hopkins is. You've got cases like that, I'm sure
          of it. Surgical addicts apply every place <br/>surgery's performed. It's no reflection on the institution or
          the legitimate patients. You <br/>think nuts don't apply to the FBI? We get 'em all the time. A man in a Moe
          hairpiece <br/>applied in St. Louis last week. He had a bazooka, two rockets, and a bearskin shako in his
          <br/>golf bag.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did you hire him?&quot; <br/>&quot;Help me, Dr. Danielson. Time's eating us up. While we're standing
          here, Buffalo <br/></p>
        <p>Bill may be turning Catherine Martin into one of these.&quot; Crawford put a photograph on <br/>the gleaming
          counter. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Don't even do that,&quot; Dr. Danielson said. &quot;That's a childish, bullying thing to do. I <br/>was
          a battle surgeon, Mr. Crawford. Put your picture back in your pocket.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sure, a surgeon can stand to look at a mutilated body,&quot; Crawford said, crumpling <br/>his cup and
          stepping on the pedal of the covered wastebasket. &quot;But I don't think a doctor <br/>can stand to see a
          life wasted.&quot; He dropped in his cup and the lid of the wastebasket came <br/>down with a satisfactory
          clang. &quot;Here's my best offer: I won't ask you for patient <br/>information, only application information
          selected by you, with reference to these <br/>guidelines. You and your psychiatric review board can handle
          your rejected applications <br/>a lot faster than I can. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information,
          I'll suppress that <br/>fact. I'll find another way we could have done it and we'll walk through it that way,
          for <br/>the record.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Could Johns Hopkins be a protected witness, Mr. Crawford? Could we have a <br/>new identity? Move us to
          Bob Jones College, say? I doubt very much that the FBI or any <br/>other government agency can keep a secret
          very long.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You'd be surprised.&quot; <br/>&quot;I doubt it. Trying to crawl out from under an inept bureaucratic
          lie would be </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">

        much.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Thank <i>you</i>, Dr. Danielson, for your humorous remarks. They're very helpful to <br/>me--- I'll
          show you how in a minute. You like the truth--- try this. He kidnaps young <br/>women and rips their skins
          off. He puts on these skins and capers around in them. We <br/>don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't
          help me as fast as you can, this is what I'll <br/>do to you: this morning the Justice Department will ask
          publicly for a court order, saying <br/>you've refused to help. We'll ask twice a day, in plenty of time for
          the A.M. and P.M. <br/>news cycles. Every news release from Justice about this case will say how we're coming
          <br/>along with Dr. Danielson at Johns Hopkins, trying to get him to pitch in. Every time <br/>there's news in
          the Buffalo Bill case--- when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one <br/>floats, and the next one
          floats--- we'll issue a news release right away about how we're <br/>doing with Dr. Danielson at Johns
          Hopkins, complete with your humorous comments <br/>about Bob Jones College. <br/></p>
        <p>One more thing, Doctor. You know, Health and Human Services is right here in <br/>Baltimore. My thoughts are
          running to the Office of Eligibility Policy, and I expect <i>your <br/></i>thoughts got there first, didn't
          they? What if Senator Martin, sometime after her <br/>daughter's funeral, asked the fellows over at
          Eligibility this question: Should the sex-<br/>change operations you perform here be considered cosmetic
          surgery? Maybe they'll <br/>scratch their heads and decide, 'Why, you know, Senator Martin's <i>right. </i>Yes.
          We think <br/>it's cosmetic surgery,' then this program won't qualify for federal assistance any more <br/>than
          a nose-job clinic.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's insulting.&quot; <br/>&quot;No, it's just the truth.&quot; <br/>&quot;You don't frighten me, you
          don't intimidate me---&quot; <br/>&quot;Good. I don't want to do either one, Doctor. I just want you to know
          I'm serious. <br/></p>
        <p>Help me, Doctor. Please.&quot; <br/>&quot;You said you're working with Alan Bloom.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes. The
          University of Chicago---&quot; <br/>&quot;I know Alan Bloom, and I'd rather discuss this on a professional
          level. Tell him <br/></p>
        <p>I'll be in touch with him this morning. Ill tell you what I've decided before noon. I do care <br/>about the
          young woman, Mr. Crawford. And the others. But there's a lot at stake here, <br/>and I don't think it's as
          important to you as it ought to be... Mr. Crawford, have you had <br/>your blood pressure checked recently?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I do it myself.&quot; <br/>&quot;And do you prescribe for yourself?&quot; <br/>&quot;That's against the
          law, Dr. Danielson.&quot; <br/>&quot;But you have a doctor.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Share your
          findings with him, Mr. Crawford. What a loss to us all if you dropped <br/></p>
        <p>dead. You'll hear from me later in the morning.&quot; <br/>&quot;How much later, Doctor? How about an hour?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;An hour.&quot; <br/>Crawford's beeper sounded as he got off the elevator at the ground floor. His

        <p>driver, Jeff, was beckoning as Crawford trotted to the van. <i>She's dead and they found her, <br/></i>Crawford

        had authorized the extradition to Tennessee of Dr. <br/>Hannibal Lecter. It would take all the muscle of the
        Federal Court, District of Maryland, <br/>to prevent or delay the move. The Director wanted a judgment call from
        Crawford and he <br/>wanted it now. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; Crawford said. He held the receiver on his thigh and looked out the <br/>van window.
          There wasn't much color in February for the first light to find. All gray. So <br/>bleak. <br/></p>
        <p>Jeff started to say something and Crawford hushed him with a motion of his hand. <br/>Lecter's monster ego.
          Chilton's ambition. Senator Martin's terror for her child. <br/></p>
        <p>Catherine Martin's life. Call it. <br/>&quot;Let them go,&quot; he said into the phone. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER
          29 <br/> <br/>D</b>r. Chilton and three well-pressed Tennessee state troopers stood close together <br/></p>
        <p>on the windy tarmac at sunrise, raising their voices over a wash of radio traffic from the <br/>open door of
          the Grumman Gulfstream and from the ambulance idling beside the <br/>airplane. <br/></p>
        <p>The trooper captain in charge handed Dr. Chilton a pen. The papers blew over the <br/>end of the clipboard
          and the policeman had to smooth them down. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Can't we do this in the 'air?&quot; Chilton asked. <br/>&quot;Sir, we have to do the documentation at
          the moment of physical transfer. That's <br/></p>
        <p>my instructions.&quot; <br/>The copilot finished clamping the ramp over the airplane steps. &quot;Okay,&quot;
          he called. <br/>The troopers gathered with Dr. Chilton at the back of the ambulance. When he <br/></p>
        <p>opened the back doors, they tensed as though they expected something to jump out. ' <br/>Dr. Hannibal Lecter
          stood upright on his hand truck, wrapped in canvas webbing <br/></p>
        <p>and wearing his hockey mask. He was relieving his bladder while Barney held the urinal. <br/>One of the
          troopers snorted. The other two looked away. <br/>&quot;Sorry,&quot; Barney said to Dr. Lecter, and closed the
          doors again. <br/>&quot;That's all right, Barney,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. &quot;I'm quite finished, thank you.&quot;
          <br/>Barney rearranged Lecter's clothing and rolled him to the back of the ambulance. <br/>&quot;Barney?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Yes, Dr. Lecter?&quot; <br/>&quot;You've been decent to me for a long time. Thank you.&quot; <br/>&quot;You're
          welcome.&quot; <br/>&quot;Next time Sammie's at himself, would you say good-bye for me?&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Good-bye, Barney.&quot; <br/>The big orderly pushed open the doors and called to the troopers.
          &quot;You want to <br/></p>
        <p>catch the bottom there, fellows? Take it on both sides. We'll set him on the ground. <br/>Easy.&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Barney rolled. Dr. Lecter up the ramp and into the airplane. Three seats had been </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>removed on the craft's right side. The copilot lashed the hand truck to the seat brackets in <br/>the
        floor. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He's gonna fly laying down?&quot; one trooper asked. &quot;Has he got rubber britches <br/>on?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You'll just have to hold your water to Memphis, buddy ruff,&quot; the other trooper <br/>said. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Doctor Chilton, could I speak to you?&quot; Barney said. <br/>They stood outside the airplane while the
          wind made little twisters of dust and <br/></p>
        <p>trash around them. <br/>&quot;These fellows don't know anything,&quot; Barney said. <br/>&quot;I'll have some
          help on the other end--- experienced psychiatric orderlies. He's <br/></p>
        <p>their responsibility now.&quot; <br/>&quot;You think they'll treat him all right? You know how he is--- you
          have to threaten <br/></p>
        <p>him with boredom. That's all he's afraid of. Slapping him around's no good.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'd never allow
          that, Barney.&quot; <br/>&quot;You'll be there when they question him?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <i>And you
            won't, </i>Chilton added privately. <br/>&quot;I could get him settled on the other end and be back here
          just a couple of hours <br/></p>
        <p>behind my shift,&quot; Barney said. <br/>&quot;He's not your job anymore, Barney. I'll be there. I'll show
          them how to manage <br/></p>
        <p>him, every step.&quot; <br/>&quot;They better pay attention,&quot; Barney said.
          <i>&quot;He </i>will.&quot;<i> <br/></i> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 30 <br/> <br/>C</b>larice Starling sat on the
          side of her motel bed and stared at the black telephone <br/></p>
        <p>for almost a minute after Crawford hung up. Her hair was tousled and she had twisted her <br/>FBI Academy
          nightgown about her, tossing in her short sleep. She felt like she had been <br/>kicked in the stomach. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>It had only been three hours since she left Dr. Lecter, and two hours since she and <br/>Crawford finished
          working out the sheet of characteristics to check against applications at <br/>the medical centers. In that
          short time, while she slept, Dr. Frederick Chilton had <br/>managed to screw it up. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was coming for her. She needed to get ready, had to think about getting <br/>ready. <br/></p>
        <p><i>God dammit. God DAMMIT. GOD DAMMIT. You've killed her, Dr. Chilton. <br/>You've killed her, Dr. Fuck Face.
          Lecter knew some more and I could have gotten it. All <br/>gone, all gone, now. All for nothing. When
          Catherine Martin floats, I'll see that you have <br/>to look at her, I swear I will. You took it away from me.
          I really have to have something <br/>useful to do. Right now. What can I do right now, what can I do this
          minute? Get clean. <br/></i></p>
        <p>In the bathroom, a little basket of paper-wrapped soaps, tubes of shampoo and <br/>lotion, a little sewing
          kit, the favors you get at a good motel. <br/></p>
        <p>Stepping into the shower, Starling saw in a flash herself at eight, bringing in the <br/>towels and the
          shampoo and paper-wrapped soap to her mother when her mother cleaned <br/>motel rooms. When she was eight,
          there was a crow, one of a flock on the gritty wind of </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>that sour town, and this crow liked to steal from the motel cleaning carts. It took anything <br/>bright.
        The crow would wait for its chance, and then rummage among the many <br/>housekeeping items on the cart.
        Sometimes, in an emergency takeoff, it crapped on the <br/>clean linens. One of the other cleaning women threw
        bleach at it, to no effect except to <br/>mottle its feathers with snow-white patches. The black-and-white crow
        was always <br/>watching for Clarice to leave the cart, to take things to her mother, who was scrubbing <br/>bathrooms.
        Her mother was standing in the door of a motel bathroom when she told <br/>Starling she would have to go away,
        to live in Montana. Her mother put down the towels <br/>she was holding and sat down on the side of the motel
        bed and held her. Starling still <br/>dreamed about the crow, saw it now with no time to think why. Her hand
        came up in a <br/>shooing motion and then, as though it needed to excuse the gesture, her hand continued to
        <br/>her forehead to slick back the wet hair. <br/></p>
        <p>She dressed quickly. Slacks, blouse, and a light sweater vest, the snub-nosed <br/>revolver tucked tight
          against her ribs in the pancake holster, the speedloader straddling <br/>her belt on the other side. Her
          blazer needed a little work. A seam in the lining was <br/>fraying over the speedloader. She was determined to
          be busy, be busy, until she cooled <br/>off. She got the motel's little paper sewing kit and tacked the lining
          down. Some agents <br/>sewed washers into the tail of the jacket so it would swing away cleanly, she'd have to
          do <br/>that... <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was knocking on the door. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 31 <br/> <br/>I</b>n Crawford's experience,
          anger made women look tacky. Rage made their hair <br/></p>
        <p>stick out behind and played hell with their color and they forgot to zip. Any unattractive <br/>feature was
          magnified. Starling looked herself when she opened the door of her motel <br/>room, but she was mad all right.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford knew he might learn a large new truth about her now. <br/>Fragrance of soap and steamy air puffed at
          him as she stood in the doorway The <br/></p>
        <p>covers on the bed behind her had been pulled up over the pillow. <br/>&quot;What do you <i>say</i>, Starling?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I say God dammit, Mr. Crawford, what do <i>you </i>say?&quot; <br/>He beckoned with his head.
          &quot;Drugstore's open on the corner already. We'll get <br/></p>
        <p>some coffee.&quot; <br/>It was a mild morning for February. The sun, still low in the east, shined red on
          <br/></p>
        <p>the front of the asylum as they walked past. Jeff trailed them slowly in the van, the radios <br/>crackling.
          Once he handed a phone out the window to Crawford for a brief conversation. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Can I file obstruction of justice on Chilton?&quot; <br/>Starling was walking slightly ahead. Crawford
          could see her jaw muscles bunch <br/></p>
        <p>after she asked. <br/>&quot;No, it wouldn't stick.&quot; <br/>&quot;What if he's wasted her, what if
          Catherine dies because of him? I really want to <br/></p>
        <p>get in his face... Let me stay with this, Mr. Crawford. Don't send me back to school.&quot; <br/>&quot;Two
          things. If I keep you, it won't be to get in Chilton's face, that comes later. <br/></p>
        <p>Second, if I keep you much longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you some months. The </p>

        for you, I can tell you that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>She leaned her head far back, then put it down again, walking. &quot;Maybe this isn't a <br/>polite question
          to ask the boss, but are you in the glue? Can Senator Martin do anything <br/>to you?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Starling, I have to retire in two years. If I find Jimmy Hoffa and the Tylenol <br/>killer I still have
          to hang it up. It's not a consideration.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford, ever wary of desire, knew how badly he wanted to be wise. He knew <br/>that a middle-aged man can
          be so desperate for wisdom he may try to make some up, and <br/>how deadly that can be to a youngster who
          believes him. So he spoke carefully, and only <br/>of things he knew. <br/></p>
        <p>What Crawford told her on that mean street in Baltimore he had learned in a <br/>succession of freezing dawns
          in Korea, in a war before she was born. He left the Korea <br/>part out, since he didn't need it for
          authority. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;This is the hardest time, Starling. Use this time and it'll temper you. Now's the <br/>hardest test---
          not letting rage and frustration keep you from thinking. It's the core of <br/>whether you can command or not.
          Waste and stupidity get you the worst. Chilton's a God <br/>damned fool and he may have cost Catherine Martin
          her life. But maybe not. We're her <br/>chance. Starling, how cold is liquid nitrogen in the lab?&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;What? Ah, liquid nitrogen... minus two hundred degrees Centigrade, about. It <br/>boils at a little
          more than that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did you ever freeze stuff with it?&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure.&quot; <br/>&quot;I want you to freeze
          something now. Freeze the business with Chilton. Keep the <br/></p>
        <p>information you got from Lecter and freeze the feelings. I want you to keep your eyes on <br/>the prize,
          Starling. That's all that matters. You worked for some information, paid for it, <br/>got it, now we'll use
          it. It's just as good--- or as worthless--- as it was before Chilton <br/>messed in this. We just won't get
          any more from Lecter, probably. Take the knowledge of <br/>Buffalo Bill you got from Lecter and keep it.
          Freeze the rest. The waste, the loss, your <br/>anger, Chilton. Freeze it. When we have time, we'll kick
          Chilton's butt up between his <br/>shoulder blades. Freeze it now and slide it aside. So you can see past it
          to the prize, <br/>Starling. Catherine Martin's life. And Buffalo Bill's hide on the barn door. Keep your
          <br/>eyes on the prize. If you can do that, I need you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;To work with the medical records?&quot; <br/>They were in front of the drugstore now. <br/>&quot;Not
          unless the clinics stonewall us and we have to take the records. I want you in <br/></p>
        <p>Memphis. We have to hope Lecter tells Senator Martin something useful. But I want you <br/>to be close by,
          just in case--- if he gets tired of toying with her, maybe he'll talk to you. In <br/>the meantime, I want you
          to try to get a feel for Catherine, how Bill might have spotted <br/>her. You're not a lot older than
          Catherine, and her friends might tell you things they <br/>wouldn't tell somebody that looks more like a cop.

      <div><p>The red sun had reached three-quarters of the way down the telephone poles. The <br/>sidewalks were still
        violet. Starling could reach up into the light as she waved for Jeff. <br/></p>
        <p>She felt lighter, better. Crawford really was very good. She knew that his little <br/>nitrogen question was
          a nod to her forensic background, meant to please her and to <br/>trigger ingrained habits of disciplined
          thinking. She wondered if men actually regard that <br/>kind of manipulation as subtle. Curious how things can
          work on you even when you <br/>recognize them. Curious how the gift of leadership is often a coarse gift.

        <p>Across the street, a figure coming down the steps of the Baltimore State Hospital <br/>for the Criminally
          Insane. It was Barney, looking even larger in his lumber jacket. He <br/>was carrying his lunchpail. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling mouthed &quot;Five minutes&quot; to Jeff waiting in the van. She caught Barney as <br/>he was
          unlocking his old Studebaker. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Barney.&quot; <br/>He turned to face her, expressionless. His eyes may have been a bit wider than <br/>
        </p>
        <p>usual. He had his weight on both feet. <br/>&quot;Did Dr. Chilton tell you you'd be all right from this?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;What else would he tell me?&quot; <br/>&quot;You believe it?&quot; <br/>The corner of his mouth
          turned down. He didn't say yes or no. <br/>&quot;I want you to do something for me. I want you to do it now,
          with no questions. <br/></p>
        <p>I'll ask you nicely--- we'll start with that. What's left in Lecter's cell?&quot; <br/>&quot;A couple of
          books--- <i>Joy of Cooking,</i> medical journals. They took his court <br/></p>
        <p>papers.&quot; <br/>&quot;The stuff on the walls, the drawings?&quot; <br/>&quot;It's still there.&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          want it all and I'm in a hell of a hurry.&quot; <br/>He considered her for a second. &quot;Hold on,&quot; he
          said and trotted back up the steps, <br/></p>
        <p>lightly for such a big man. <br/>Crawford was waiting for her in the van when Barney came back out with
          rolled <br/></p>
        <p>drawings and the papers and books in a shopping bag. <br/>&quot;You sure I knew the bug was in that desk I
          brought you?&quot; Barney said as handed <br/></p>
        <p>her the stuff. <br/>&quot;I have to give that some thought. Here's a pen, write your phone numbers on the
          <br/></p>
        <p>bag. Barney, you think they can <i>handle </i>Dr. Lecter?&quot; <br/>&quot;I got my doubts and I said so to
          Dr. Chilton. Remember I told you that, in case it <br/></p>
        <p>slips his mind. You're all right, Officer Starling. Listen, when you get Buffalo Bill?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yeah?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Don't bring him to me just because I got a vacancy, all right?&quot; He smiled. Barney <br/></p>
        <p>had little baby teeth. <br/>Starling grinned at him in spite of herself. She flapped a wave back over her

          talked to him,&quot; Crawford said. <br/>&quot;Mr. Crawford, he's promised he'll name Buffalo Bill in exchange
          for privileges--<br/></p>
        <p>- amenities, really. If he doesn't do that, you can have him forever.&quot; <br/>&quot;Senator Martin, I know
          this is sensitive, but I have to say it to you: whatever you <br/></p>
        <p>do, don't beg him.&quot; <br/>&quot;Right, Mr. Crawford. I really can't talk right now.&quot; She hung up the
          phone. &quot;If <br/></p>
        <p>I'm wrong, she won't be any deader than the last six you handled,&quot; she said under her <br/>breath, and
          waved Gossage and Chilton into the car. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Chilton had requested an office setting in Memphis for Senator Martin's <br/>interview with Hannibal
          Lecter. To save time, an Air National Guard briefing room in the <br/>hangar had been rearranged hastily for
          the meeting. <br/></p>
        <p>Senator Martin had to wait out in the hangar while Dr. Chilton got Lecter settled <br/>in the office. She
          couldn't stand to stay in the car. She paced in a small circle beneath the <br/>great roof of the hangar,
          looking up at the high, latticed rafters and down again at the <br/>painted stripes on the floor. Once she
          stopped beside an old Phantom F-4 and rested her <br/>head against its cold side where the stencil said NO
          STEP. <i>This airplane must be older <br/>than Catherine. Sweet Jesus, come on. <br/></i></p>
        <p>&quot;Senator Martin.&quot; Major Bachman was calling her. Chilton beckoned from the <br/>door. <br/></p>
        <p>There was a desk for Chilton in the room, and chairs for Senator Martin and her <br/>assistant and for Major
          Bachman. A video cameraman was ready to record the meeting. <br/>Chilton claimed it was one of Lecter's
          requirements. <br/></p>
        <p>Senator Martin went in looking good. Her navy suit breathed power. She had put <br/>some starch in Gossage
          too. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Hannibal Lecter sat alone in the middle of the room in a stout oak armchair <br/>bolted to the floor. A
          blanket covered his straitjacket and leg restraints and concealed the <br/>fact that he was chained to the
          chair. But he still wore the hockey mask that kept him <br/>from biting. <br/></p>
        <p>Why? the Senator wondered--- the idea had been to permit Dr. Lecter some <br/>dignity in an office setting.
          Senator Martin gave Chilton a look and turned to Gossage for <br/>papers. <br/></p>
        <p>Chilton went behind Dr. Lecter and, with a glance at the camera, undid the straps <br/>and removed the mask
          with a flourish. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Senator Martin, meet Dr. Hannibal Lecter.&quot; <br/>Seeing what Dr. Chilton had done for showmanship
          frightened Senator Martin as <br/></p>
        <p>much as anything that had happened since her daughter disappeared. Any confidence she <br/>might have had in
          Chilton's judgment was replaced with the cold fear that he was a fool. <br/></p>
        <p>She'd have to wing it. <br/>A lock of Dr. Lecter's hair fell between his maroon eyes. He was as pale as the
          <br/></p>
        <p>mask. Senator Martin and Hannibal Lecter considered each other, one extremely bright <br/>and the other not
          measurable by any means known to man. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Chilton returned to his desk, looked around at everyone, and began: <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter has indicated
          to me, Senator, that he wants to contribute to the </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>investigation some special knowledge, in return for considerations regarding the <br/>conditions of his
        confinement.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Senator Martin held up a document. &quot;Dr. Lecter, this is an affidavit which I'll now <br/>sign. It says
          I'll help you. Want to read it?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>She thought he wasn't going to reply and turned to the desk to sign, when he said: <br/>&quot;I won't waste
          your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. <br/></p>
        <p>Career climbers have wasted enough already. Let me help you now, and I'll trust you to <br/>help me when it's
          over.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You can count on it. Brian?&quot; <br/>Gossage raised his pad. <br/>&quot;Buffalo Bill's name is
          William Rubin. He goes by Billy Rubin. He was referred <br/></p>
        <p>to me in April or May 1975, by my patient Benjamin Raspail. He said he lived in <br/>Philadelphia, I can't
          remember an address, but he was staying with Raspail in Baltimore.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Where are your records?&quot; Major Bachman broke in. <br/>&quot;My records were destroyed by court
          order shortly after---&quot; <br/>&quot;What did he look like?&quot; Major Bachman said. <br/>&quot;Do you <i>mind, </i>Major?
          Senator Martin, the only---&quot; <br/>&quot;Give me an age and a physical description, anything else you can
          remember,&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Major Bachman said. <br/>Dr. Lecter simply went away. He thought about something else--- G&#233;ricault's
          <br/></p>
        <p>anatomical studies for <i>The Raft of the Medusa---</i>and if he heard the questions that <br/>followed, he
          didn't show it. <br/></p>
        <p>When Senator Martin regained his attention, they were alone in the room. She had <br/>Gossage's pad. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter's eyes focused on her. &quot;That flag smells like cigars,&quot; he said.-&quot;Did you <br/>nurse
          Catherine?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Pardon me? Did I...&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you breast-feed her?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Thirsty
          work, isn't it...?&quot; <br/>When her pupils darkened, Dr. Lecter took a single sip of her pain and found it
          <br/></p>
        <p>exquisite. That was enough for today. He went on: &quot;William Rubin is about six feet one, <br/>and would
          be thirty-five years old now. He's strongly built--- about one hundred ninety <br/>pounds when I knew him and
          he's gained since then, I expect. He has brown hair and pale <br/>blue eyes. Give them that much; and then
          we'll go on.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, I'll do that,&quot; Senator Martin said. She passed her notes out the door. <br/>&quot;I only saw
          him once. He made another appointment, but he never came again.&quot; <br/>&quot;Why do you think he's Buffalo
          Bill?&quot; <br/>&quot;He was murdering people then, and doing some similar things with them, <br/></p>
        <p>anatomically. He said he wanted some help to stop, but actually he just wanted to <br/>schmooze about it. To
          <i>rap</i>.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;And you didn't--- he was sure you wouldn't turn him in?&quot; <br/>&quot;He didn't think I would, and
          he likes to take chances. I had honored the <br/></p>
        <p>confidences of his friend Raspail.&quot; <br/>&quot;<i>Raspail </i>knew he was doing this?&quot; <br/>&quot;Raspail's
          appetites ran to the louche--- he was covered with scars. </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;Billy Rubin told me he had a criminal record, but no details. I took a brief <br/>medical history.
        It was unexceptional, except for one thing: Rubin told me he once <br/>suffered from elephant ivory anthrax.
        That's all I remember, Senator Martin, and I expect <br/>you're anxious to go. If anything else occurs to me,
        I'll send you word.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did Billy Rubin kill the person whose head was in the car?&quot; <br/>&quot;I believe so.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do
          you know who that is?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. Raspail called him Klaus.&quot; <br/>&quot;Were the other things

        <p>&quot;'Thank you, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/>&quot;Love your suit,&quot; he said as she went out the door. <br/>
          <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 33 <br/> <br/>R</b>oom into room, Jame Gumb's basement rambles like the maze that
          thwarts us in <br/></p>
        <p>dreams. When he was still shy, lives and lives ago, Mr. Gumb took his pleasure in the <br/>rooms most hidden,
          far from the stairs. There are rooms in the farthest corners, rooms <br/>from other lives, that Gumb hasn't
          opened in years. Some of them are still occupied, so to <br/>speak, though the sounds from behind the doors
          peaked and trailed off to silence long <br/>ago. <br/></p>
        <p>The levels of the floors vary from room to room by as much as a foot. There are <br/>thresholds to step over,
          lintels to duck. Loads are impossible to roll and difficult to drag. <br/>To march something ahead of you---
          it stumbling and crying, begging, banging its dazed <br/>head--- is difficult, dangerous even. <br/></p>
        <p>As he grew in wisdom and in confidence, Mr. Gumb no longer felt he had to meet <br/>his needs in the hidden
          parts of the basement. He nowuses a suite of basement rooms <br/>around the stairs, large rooms with running
          water and electricity. <br/></p>
        <p>The basement is in total darkness now. <br/>Beneath the sand-floored room, in the oubliette, Catherine Martin
          is quiet. <br/>Mr. Gumb is here in the basement, but he is not in this chamber. <br/>The room beyond the
          stairs is black to human vision, but it is full of small sounds. <br/></p>
        <p>Water trickles here and small pumps hum. In little echoes the room sounds large. The air <br/>is moist and
          cool. Smell the greenery. A flutter of wings against the cheek, a few clicks <br/>across the air. A low nasal
          sound of pleasure, a human sound. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>The room has none of the wavelengths of light the human eye can use, but Mr. <br/>Gumb is here and he can
        see very well, though he sees everything in shades and <br/>intensities of green. He's wearing an excellent pair
        of infrared goggles (Israeli military <br/>surplus, less than four hundred dollars) and he directs the beam of
        an infrared flashlight <br/>on the wire cage in front of him. He is sitting on the edge of a straight chair,
        rapt, <br/>watching an insect climb a plant in the screen cage. The young imago has just emerged <br/>from a
        split chrysalis in the moist earth of the cage floor. She climbs carefully on a stalk <br/>of nightshade,
        seeking space to unfurl the damp new wings still wadded on her back. She <br/>selects a horizontal twig. <br/>
      </p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb must tilt his head to see. Little by little the wings are pumped full of <br/>blood and air. They
          are still stuck together over the insect's back. <br/></p>
        <p>Two hours pass. Mr. Gumb has hardly moved. He turns the infrared flashlight on <br/>and off to surprise
          himself with the progress the insect has made. To pass the time he <br/>plays the light over the rest of the
          room--- over his big aquariums full of vegetable <br/>tanning solution. On forms and stretchers in the tanks,
          his recent acquisitions stand like <br/>broken classic statuary green beneath the sea. His light moves over
          the big galvanized <br/>work table with its metal pillow block and backsplash and drains, touches the hoist
          above <br/>it. Against the wall, his long industrial sinks. All in the green images of filtered infrared.
          <br/>Flutters, streaks of phosphorescence cross his vision, little comet trails of moths free in <br/>the
          room. <br/></p>
        <p>He switches back to the cage just in time. The big insect's wings are held above <br/>her back, hiding and
          distorting her markings. Now she brings down her wings to cloak <br/>her body and the famous design is clear.
          A human skull, wonderfully executed in the <br/>furlike scales, stares from the back of the moth. Under the
          shaded dome of the skull are <br/>the black eye holes and prominent cheekbones. Beneath them darkness lies
          like a gag <br/>across the face above the jaw. The skull rests on a marking flared like the top of a pelvis.
          <br/></p>
        <p>A skull stacked upon a pelvis, all drawn on the back of a moth by an accident of <br/>nature. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb feels so good and light inside. He leans forward, puffs soft air across <br/>the moth. She raises
          her sharp proboscis and squeaks angrily. <br/></p>
        <p>He walks quietly with his light into the oubliette room. He opens his mouth to <br/>quiet his breathing. He
          doesn't want to spoil his mood with a lot of noise from the pit. <br/>The lenses of his goggles on their small
          protruding barrels look like crab eyes on stalks. <br/>Mr. Gumb knows the goggles aren't the least bit
          attractive, but he has had some great <br/>times with them in the black basement, playing basement games.
          <br/></p>
        <p>He leans over and shines his invisible light down the shaft. <br/>The material is lying on her side, curled
          like a shrimp. She seems to be asleep. <br/></p>
        <p>Her waste bucket stands beside her. She has not foolishly broken the string again, trying <br/>to pull
          herself up the sheer walls. In her sleep, she clutches the corner of the futon against <br/>her face and sucks
          her thumb. <br/></p>
        <p>Watching Catherine, playing the infrared flashlight up and down her, Mr. Gumb <br/>prepares himself for the
          very real problems ahead. <br/></p>
        <p>The human skin is fiendishly difficult to deal with if your standards are as high as <br/>Mr. Gumb's. There
          are fundamental structural decisions to make, and the first one is <br/>where to put the zipper. <br/></p>
        <p>He moves the beam down Catherine's back. Normally he would put the closure in </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>the back, but then how could he don it alone? It won't be the sort of thing he can ask <br/>someone to
        help him with, exciting as that prospect might be. He knows of places, <br/>circles, where his efforts would be
        much admired--- there are certain yachts where he <br/>could preen--- but that will have to wait. He must have
        things he can use alone. To split <br/>the center front would be sacrilege--- he puts that right out of his
        mind. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb can tell nothing of Catherine's color by infrared, but she looks thinner. <br/>He believes she may
          have been dieting when he took her. <br/></p>
        <p>Experience has taught him to wait from four days to a week before harvesting the <br/>hide. Sudden weight
          loss makes the hide looser and easier to remove. In addition, <br/>starvation takes much of his subjects'
          strength and makes them more manageable. More <br/>docile. A stuporous resignation comes over some of them. At
          the same time, it's <br/>necessary to provide a few rations to prevent despair and destructive tantrums that
          might <br/>damage the skin. <br/></p>
        <p>It definitely has lost weight. This one is so special, so central to what he is doing, <br/>he can't stand to
          wait long, and he doesn't have to. Tomorrow afternoon, he can do it, or <br/>tomorrow night. The next day at
          the latest. Soon. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 34 <br/> <br/>C</b>larice Starling recognized the Stonehinge Villas sign from
          television news. The <br/></p>
        <p>East Memphis housing complex, a mix of flats and town houses, formed a large U around <br/>a parking field.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Starling parked her rented Chevrolet Celebrity in the middle of the big lot. Well-<br/>paid blue-collar
          workers and bottom-echelon executives lived here--- the TransAms and <br/>IROC-Z Camaros told her that. Motor
          homes for the weekends and ski boats bright with <br/>glitter paint were parked in their own section of the
          lot. <br/></p>
        <p>Stonehinge Villas--- the spelling grated on Starling every time she looked at it. <br/>Probably the
          apartments were full of white wicker and peach shag. Snapshots under the <br/>glass of the coffee table. The
          <i>Dinner for Two Cookbook </i>and <i>Fondue on the Menu</i>. <br/>Starling, whose only residence was a
          dormitory room at the FBI Academy, was a severe <br/>critic of these things. <br/></p>
        <p>She needed to know Catherine Baker Martin, and this seemed an odd place for a <br/>senator's daughter to
          live. Starling had read the brief biographical material the FBI had <br/>gathered, and it showed Catherine
          Martin to be a bright underachiever. She'd failed at <br/>Farmington and had two unhappy years at Middlebury.
          Now she was a student at <br/>Southwestern and a practice teacher. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling could easily have pictured her as a self-absorbed, blunted, boarding-<br/>school kid, one of those
          people who never listen. Starling knew she had to be careful here <br/>because she had her own prejudices and
          resentments. Starling had done her time in <br/>boarding schools, living on scholarships, her grades much
          better than her clothes. She had <br/>seen a lot of kids from rich, troubled families, with too much
          boarding-school time. She <br/>didn't give a damn about some of them, but she had grown to learn that
          inattention can be <br/>a stratagem to avoid pain, and that it is often misread as shallowness and
          indifference. <br/></p>
        <p>Better to think of Catherine as a child sailing with her father, as she was in the <br/>film they showed with
          Senator Martin's plea on television. She wondered if Catherine </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>tried to please her father when she was little. She wondered what Catherine was doing <br/>when they came
        and told her that her father was dead, of a heart attack at forty-two. <br/>Starling was positive Catherine
        missed him. Missing your father, the common wound, <br/>made Starling feel close to this young woman. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling found it essential to like Catherine Martin because it helped her to bear <br/>down. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling could see where Catherine's apartment was located--- two Tennessee <br/>Highway Patrol cruisers were
          parked in front of it. There were spots of white powder on <br/>the parking lot in the area closest to the
          apartment. The Tennessee Bureau of <br/>Investigation must have been lifting oil stains with pumice or some
          other inert powder. <br/>Crawford said the TBI was pretty good. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling walked over to the recreational vehicles and boats parked in the special <br/>section of the lot in
          front of the apartment. This is where Buffalo Bill got her. Close <br/>enough to her door so that she left it
          unlocked when she came out. Something tempted <br/>her out. It must have beep a harmless-looking setup. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Starling knew the Memphis police had done exhaustive door-to-door interviews <br/>and nobody had seen
          anything, so maybe it happened among the tall motor homes. He <br/>must have watched from here. Sitting in
          some kind of vehicle, had to be. But Buffalo Bill <br/><i>knew </i>Catherine was here. He must have spotted
          her somewhere and stalked her, waiting <br/>for his chance. Girls the size of Catherine aren't common. He
          didn't just sit around at <br/>random locations until a woman of the right size came by. He could sit for days
          and not <br/>see one. <br/></p>
        <p>All the victims were big. All of them were big. Some were fat, but all were big. <br/>&quot;So he can get
          something that will fit.&quot; Remembering Dr. Lecter's words, Starling <br/>shuddered. Dr. Lecter, the new
          Memphian. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling took a deep breath, puffed up her cheeks and let the air out slowly. <i>Let's <br/>see what we can
          tell about Catherine. <br/></i></p>
        <p>A Tennessee state trooper wearing his Smokey the Bear hat answered the door of <br/>Catherine Martin's
          apartment. When Starling showed him her credentials, he motioned <br/>her inside. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Officer, I need to look over the premises here.&quot; <i>Premises </i>seemed a good word to <br/>use to
          a man who had his hat on in the house. <br/></p>
        <p>He nodded: &quot;If the phone rings, leave it alone. I'll answer it.&quot; <br/>On the counter in the open
          kitchen Starling could see a tape recorder attached to <br/></p>
        <p>the telephone. Beside it were two new telephones. One had no dial--- a direct line to <br/>Southern Bell
          security, the mid-South tracing facility. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Can I help you any way?&quot; the young officer asked. <br/>&quot;Are the police through in here'&quot;
          <br/>&quot;The apartment's been released to the family. I'm just here for the telephone. You <br/></p>
        <p>can touch stuff, if that's what you want to know.&quot; <br/>&quot;Good, I'll look around then.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay.&quot;
          The young policeman retrieved the newspaper he had stuffed beneath the <br/></p>
        <p>couch and resumed his seat. <br/>Starling wanted to concentrate. She wished she were alone in the apartment,
          but <br/></p>
        <p>she knew she was lucky the place wasn't full of cops. <br/>She started in the kitchen. It was not equipped by
          a serious cook. Catherine had </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>come for popcorn, the boyfriend had told police. Starling opened the freezer. There were <br/>two boxes of
        microwave popcorn. You couldn't see the parking lot from the kitchen. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Where you from?&quot; <br/>Starling didn't register the question the first time. <br/>&quot;Where you
          from?&quot; <br/>The trooper on the couch was watching her over his newspaper. <br/>&quot;Washington,&quot;
          she said. <br/>Under the sink--- yep, scratches on the pipe joint, they'd taken the trap out and <br/></p>
        <p>examined it. Good for the TBI. The knives were not sharp. The dishwasher had been run, <br/>but not emptied.
          The refrigerator was devoted to cottage cheese and deli fruit salad. <br/>Catherine Martin shopped for
          fast-food groceries, probably had a regular place, a drive-in <br/>she used close by. Maybe somebody cruised
          the store. That's worth checking. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You with the Attorney General?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, the FBI.&quot; <br/>&quot;The Attorney General's
          coming. That's what I heard at turnout. How long you <br/></p>
        <p>been in the FBI?&quot; <br/>There was a rubber cabbage in the vegetable drawer. Starling rolled it over and
          <br/></p>
        <p>checked the jewelry compartment inside. Empty. <br/>&quot;How long you been in the FBI?&quot; <br/>Starling
          looked at the young policeman. <br/>&quot;Officer, tell you what. I'll probably need to ask you a couple of
          things after I've <br/></p>
        <p>finished looking around here. Maybe you could help me out then.&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure. If I can---&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Good, okay. Let's wait and talk then. I have to think about this right now.&quot; <br/>&quot;No
          problem, there.&quot; <br/>The bedroom was bright, with a sunny, drowsy quality Starling liked. It was done
          <br/></p>
        <p>with better fabrics and better furnishings than most young women could afford. There <br/>was a Coromandel
          screen, two pieces of cloisonn&#233; on the shelves, and a good secretary in <br/>burled walnut. Twin beds.
          Starling lifted the edge of the coverlets. Rollers were locked <br/>on the left bed, but not on the right-hand
          one. <i>Catherine must push them together when it <br/>suits her. May have a lover the boyfriend doesn't know
            about. Or maybe they stay over <br/>here sometimes. There's no remote beeper on her answering machine. She
            may need to be <br/>here when her mom calls. <br/></i></p>
        <p>The answering machine was like her own, the basic Phone-Mate. She opened the <br/>top panel. Both incoming
          and outgoing tapes were gone. In their place was a note, <br/>TAPES TBI PROPERTY #6. <br/></p>
        <p>The room was reasonably neat but it had the ruffled appearance left by searchers <br/>with big hands, men who
          try to put things back exactly, but miss just a little bit. Starling <br/>would have known the place had been
          searched even without the traces of fingerprint <br/>power on all the smooth surfaces. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling didn't believe that any part of the crime had happened in the bedroom. <br/>Crawford probably was
          right, Catherine had been grabbed in the parking lot. But Starling <br/>wanted to know her, and this is where
          she lived. <i>Lives</i>, Starling corrected herself. She <br/><i>lives </i>here. <br/></p>
        <p>In the cabinet of the nightstand were a telephone book, Kleenex, a box of <br/>grooming items and, behind the
          box, a Polaroid SX-70 camera with a cable release and a </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>short tripod folded beside it. Ummmm. Intent as a lizard, Starling looked at the camera. <br/>She blinked
        as a lizard blinks and didn't touch it. <br/></p>
        <p>The closet interested Starling most. Catherine Baker Martin, laundry mark C-B-<br/>M, had a lot of clothes
          and some of them were very good. Starling recognized many of <br/>the labels, including Garfinkel's and
          Britches in Washington. <i>Presents from Mommy, <br/></i>Starling said to herself. Catherine had fine, classic
          clothes in two sizes, made to fit her at <br/>about 145 and 165 pounds, Starling guessed, and there were a few
          pairs of crisis fat pants <br/>and pullovers from the Statuesque Shop. In a hanging rack were twenty-three
          pairs of <br/>shoes. Seven pairs were Ferragamos in 10C, and there were some Reeboks and run-over <br/>loafers.
          A light backpack and a tennis racket were on the top shelf. <br/></p>
        <p>The belongings of a privileged kid, a student and practice teacher who lived better <br/>than most. <br/></p>
        <p>Lots of letters in the secretary. Loopy backhand notes from former classmates in <br/>the East. Stamps,
          mailing labels. Gift wrapping paper in the bottom drawer, a sheaf in <br/>various colors and patterns.
          Starling's fingers walked through it. She was thinking about <br/>questioning the clerks at the local drive-in
          market when her fingers found a sheet in the <br/>stack of gift wrap that was too thick and stiff. Her fingers
          went past it, walked back to it. <br/>She was trained to register anomalies and she had it half pulled out
          when she looked at it. <br/>The sheet was blue, of a material similar to a lightweight blotter, and the
          pattern printed <br/>on it was a crude imitation of the cartoon dog Pluto. The little rows of dogs all looked
          <br/>like Pluto, they were the proper yellow, but they weren't exactly right in their proportions. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Catherine, Catherine,&quot; Starling said. She took some tweezers from her bag and <br/>used them to
          slide the sheet of colored paper into a plastic envelope. She placed it on the <br/>bed for the time being.
          <br/></p>
        <p>The jewelry box on the dresser was a stamped-leather affair, the kind you see in <br/>every girl's dormitory
          room. The two drawers in front and the tiered lid contained <br/>costume jewelry, no valuable pieces. Starling
          wondered if the best things had been in the <br/>rubber cabbage in the refrigerator, and if so, who took them.
          <br/></p>
        <p>She hooked her finger under the side of the lid and released the secret drawer in <br/>the back of the
          jewelry box. The secret drawer was empty. She wondered whom these <br/>drawers were a secret from--- certainly
          not burglars. She was reaching behind the jewelry <br/>box, pushing the drawer back in, when her fingers
          touched the envelope taped to the <br/>underside of the secret draw. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling pulled on a pair of cotton gloves and turned the jewelry box around. She <br/>took out the empty
          drawer and inverted it. A brown envelope was taped to the bottom of <br/>the drawer with masking tape: The
          flap was just tucked in, not sealed. She held the paper <br/>close to her nose. The envelope had not been
          fumed for fingerprints. Starling used the <br/>tweezers to open it and extract the contents. There were five
          Polaroid pictures in the <br/>envelope and she took them out one by one. The pictures were of a man and a
          woman <br/>coupling. No heads or faces appeared. Two of the pictures were taken by the woman, two <br/>by the
          man, and one appeared to have been shot from the tripod set up on the nightstand. <br/></p>
        <p>It was hard to judge scale in a photograph, but with that spectacular 145 pounds <br/>on a long frame, the
          woman had to be Catherine Martin. The man wore what appeared to <br/>be a carved ivory ring on his penis. The
          resolution of the photograph was not sharp <br/>enough to reveal the details of it. The man had had his
          appendix out. Starling bagged the <br/>photographs, each in a sandwich bag, and put them in her own brown
          envelope. She </p>

        voice behind her. &quot;I don't think <br/></p>
        <p>anything was taken.&quot; Starling looked in. the mirror. Senator Ruth Martin stood in the <br/>bedroom door.
          She looked drained. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling turned around. &quot;Hello, Senator Martin. Would you like to lie down? I'm <br/>almost finished.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Even exhausted, Senator Martin had a lot of presence. Under her careful finish, <br/>Starling saw a scrapper.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Who are you, please? I thought the police were through in here.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm Clarice Starling,
          FBI. Did you talk to Dr. Lecter, Senator?&quot; <br/>&quot;He gave me a name.&quot; Senator Martin lit a
          cigarette and looked Starling up and <br/></p>
        <p>down. &quot;We'll see what it's worth. And what did you find in the jewelry box, Officer <br/>Starling?
          What's <i>it </i>worth?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Some documentation we can check out in just a few minutes,&quot; was the best <br/>Starling could do.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;In my daughter's jewelry box? Let's see it.&quot; <br/>Starling heard voices in the next room and hoped
          for an interruption. &quot;Is Mr. <br/></p>
        <p>Copley with you, the Memphis special agent in---&quot; <br/>&quot;No, he's not, and that's not an answer. No
          offense, Officer, but I'll see what you <br/></p>
        <p>got out of my daughter's jewelry box.&quot; She turned her head and called over her shoulder. <br/>&quot;Paul.
          Paul, would you come in here? Officer Starling, you may know Mr. Krendler from <br/>the Department of Justice.
          Paul, this is the girl Jack Crawford sent in to Lecter.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Krendler's bald spot was tanned and he looked fit at forty. <br/>&quot;Mr. Krendler, I know who you are.
          Hello,&quot; Starling said. <i>DeeJay Criminal <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>Division congressional liaison, troubleshooter, at least an Assistant Deputy Attorney <br/>General, Jesus
          God, save my bod. <br/></i></p>
        <p>&quot;Officer Starling found something in my daughte'r's jewelry box and she put it in <br/>her brown
          envelope. I think we'd better see what it is, don't you?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Officer,&quot; Krendler said. <br/>&quot;May I speak to you, Mr. Krendler?&quot; <br/>&quot;Of course
          you can. Later.&quot; He held out his hand. <br/>Starling's face was hot. She knew Senator Martin was not
          herself, but she would <br/></p>
        <p>never forgive Krendler for the doubt in his face. Never. <br/>&quot;You got it,&quot; Starling said. She
          handed him the envelope. <br/>Krendler looked in at the first picture and had closed the flap again when
          Senator <br/></p>
        <p>Martin took the envelope out of his hands. <br/>It was painful to watch her examine the pictures. When she
          finished, she went to <br/></p>
        <p>the window and stood with her face turned up to the overcast sky, her eyes closed. She <br/>looked old in the
          daylight and her hand trembled when she tried to smoke. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Senator, I---&quot; Krendler began. <br/>&quot;The police searched this room, &quot; Senator Martin
          said. &quot;I'm sure they found those <br/></p>
        <p>pictures and had sense enough to put them back and keep their mouths shut.&quot; <br/>&quot;No they did <i>not</i>,&quot;
          Starling said. The woman was wounded but, hell. &quot;Mrs. <br/></p>
        <p>Martin, we need to know who this man is, you can see that. If it's the boyfriend, fine. I <br/>can find that
          out in five minutes. Nobody else needs to see the pictures and Catherine <br/>never needs to know.&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;I'll tend to it.&quot; Senator Martin put the envelope in her purse, and Krendler let her <br/>do
        it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Senator, did you take the jewelry out of the rubber cabbage in the kitchen?&quot; <br/>Starling asked.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Senator Martin's aide, Brian Gossage, stuck his head in the door. &quot;Excuse me, <br/>Senator, they've got
          the terminal set up. We can watch them search the William Robin <br/>name at the FBI.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Go ahead, Senator Martin,&quot; Krendlei said. &quot;I'll be out in a second.&quot; <br/>Ruth Martin
          left the room without answering Starling's question. <br/>Starling had a chance to look Krendler over as he
          was closing the bedroom door. <br/></p>
        <p>His suit was a triumph of single-needle tailoring and he was not armed. The shine was <br/>buffed off the
          bottom half-inch of his heels from walking on much deep carpet, and the <br/>edges of the heels were sharp.
          <br/></p>
        <p>He stood for a moment with his hand on the doorknob, his head down. <br/>&quot;That was a good search,&quot;
          he said when he turned around. <br/>Starling couldn't be had that cheap. She looked back at him. <br/>&quot;They
          turn out good rummagers at Quantico,&quot; Krendler said. <br/>&quot;They don't turn out thieves.&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          know that,&quot; he said. <br/>&quot;Hard to tell.&quot; <br/>&quot;Drop it.&quot; <br/>&quot;We'll follow up
          on the pictures and the rubber cabbage, right?&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;What's the
          'William Rubin' name, Mr. Krendler?&quot; <br/>&quot;Lecter says that's Buffalo Bill's name. Here's our
          transmission to ID section and <br/></p>
        <p>NCIC. Look at this.&quot; He gave her a transcript of the Lecter interview with Senator <br/>Martin, blurry
          copy from a dot-matrix printer. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Any thoughts?&quot; he said when she finished reading. <br/>&quot;There's nothing here he'll ever have
          to eat,&quot; Starling said. &quot;He says it's a white <br/></p>
        <p>male named Billy Rubin who had elephant ivory anthrax. You couldn't catch him in a lie <br/>here, no matter
          what happens.' At the worst he'd just be mistaken. I hope this is true. But <br/>he could be having fun with
          her. Mr. Krendler, he's perfectly capable of that. Have you <br/>ever... met him?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Krendler shook his head and snorted air from his nose. <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter killed nine people we know of.
          He's not walking, no matter--- he <br/></p>
        <p>could raise the dead and they wouldn't let him out. So all that's left for him is <i>fun. </i>That's <br/>why
          we were playing him---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I know how you were playing him. I heard Chilton's tape. I'm not saying it was <br/>wrong--- I'm saying
          it's over. Behavioral Science can follow up what you got--- the <br/>transsexual angle--- for what it's worth.
          And you'll be back in school at Quantico <br/>tomorrow.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p><i>Oh boy.</i> &quot;I found something else.&quot; <br/>The sheet of colored paper had lain on the bed
          unnoticed. She gave it to him. <br/>&quot;What is it?&quot; <br/>&quot;Looks like a sheet of Plutos.&quot; She
          made him ask the rest. <br/>He beckoned for the information with his hand. </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;I'm pretty sure it's blotter acid. LSD. From maybe the middle seventies or, <br/>before. It's a
        curiosity now. It's worth finding out where she got it. We should test it to be <br/>sure.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You can take it back to Washington and give it to the lab. You'll be going in a <br/>few minutes.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;If you don't want to wait, we can do it now with a field kit. If the police've got a <br/>standard
          Narcotics Identification Kit, it's test J, take two seconds, we can---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Back to Washington, back to school,&quot; he said, opening the door. <br/>&quot;Mr. Crawford instructed
          me---&quot; <br/>&quot;Your <i>instructions </i>are what I'm telling you. You're not under Jack Crawford's
          <br/></p>
        <p>direction now. You're back under the same supervision as any other trainee forthwith, and <br/>your business
          is at Quantico, do you understand me? There's a plane at two-ten. Be on it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Mr. Krendler, Dr. Letter talked to me after he refused to talk to the Baltimore <br/>police. He might
          do that again. Mr. Crawford thought---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Krendler closed the door again, harder than he had to. &quot;Officer Starling, I don't <br/>have to explain
          myself to you, but listen to me. Behavioral Science's brief is advisory, <br/>always has been. It's going back
          to that. Jack Crawford should be on compassionate leave <br/>anyway. I'm surprised he's been able to perform
          as well as he has. He took a foolish <br/>chance with this, keeping it from Senator Martin, and he got his
          butt sawed off. With his <br/>record, this close to retirement, even <i>she </i>can't hurt him that much. So I
          wouldn't worry <br/>about his pension, if I were you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling lost it a little. &quot;You've got somebody else who's caught three serial <br/>murderers? You know
          anybody else who's caught one? You shouldn't let her run this, Mr. <br/>Krendler.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You must be a bright kid, or Crawford wouldn't bother with you, so I'll tell you <br/>one time: do
          something about that mouth or it'll put you in the typing pool. Don't you <br/>understand--- the only reason
          you were ever sent to Lecter in the first place was to get <br/>some news for your Director to use on Capitol
          Hill. Harmless stuff on major crimes, the <br/>'inside scoop' on Dr. Lecter, he hands that stuff out like
          pocket candy while he's trying to <br/>get the budget through. Congressmen eat it up, they dine out on it.
          You're out of line, <br/>Officer Starling, and you're out of this case. I know you got supplementary ID. Let's
          have <br/>it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I need the ID to fly with the gun. The gun belongs at Quantico.&quot; <br/>&quot;Gun. <i>Jesus</i>.
          Turn in the ID as soon as you get back.&quot; <br/>Senator Martin, Gossage, a technician, and several
          policemen were gathered <br/></p>
        <p>around a video display terminal with a modem connected to the telephone. The National <br/>Crime Information
          Center's hotline kept a running account of progress as Dr. Lecter's <br/>information was processed in
          Washington. Here was news from the National Centers for <br/>Disease Control in Atlanta: Elephant ivory
          anthrax is contracted by breathing dust from <br/>grinding African ivory, usually for decorative handles. In
          the United States it is a disease <br/>of knifemakers. <br/></p>
        <p>At the word &quot;knifemakers,&quot; Senator Martin closed her eyes. They were hot and <br/>dry. She squeezed
          the Kleenex in her hand. <br/></p>
        <p>The young trooper who had let Starling into the apartment was bringing the <br/>Senator a cup of coffee. He
          still had on his hat. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling was damned if she'd slink out. She stopped before the woman and said, </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;Good luck, Senator. I hope Catherine's all right.&quot; <br/>Senator Martin nodded without looking
        at her. Krendler urged Starling out. <br/>&quot;I didn't know she wasn't s'posed to be in here,&quot; the young
        trooper said as she left <br/></p>
        <p>the room. <br/>Krendler stepped outside with her. &quot;I have nothing but respect for Jack <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford,&quot; he said. &quot;Please tell him how sorry we all are about... Bella's problem, all that. <br/>Now
          let's get back to school and get busy, all right?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Good-bye, Mr. Krendler.&quot; <br/>Then she was alone on the parking lot, with the unsteady feeling
          that she <br/></p>
        <p>understood nothing at all in this world. <br/>She watched a pigeon walk around beneath the motor homes and
          boats. It picked <br/></p>
        <p>up a peanut hull and put it back down. The damp wind rued its feathers. <br/>Starling wished she could talk
          to Crawford.<i> Waste and stupidity get you the worst,</i> <br/></p>
        <p>that's what he said.<i> Use this time and it'll temper you. Now's the hardest test--- not letting <br/>rage
          and frustration keep you from thinking. It's the core of whether you can command or <br/>not. <br/></i></p>
        <p>She didn't give a damn about commanding. She found she didn't give a damn, or a <br/>shit for that matter,
          about being Special Agent Starling. Not if you play this way. <br/></p>
        <p>She thought about the poor, fat, sad, dead girl she saw on the table in the funeral <br/>home at Potter, West
          Virginia.<i> Painted her nails with glitter just like these God damned <br/>redneck ski boats. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>What was her name? Kimberly. <br/>Damn if these assholes are gonna see me cry. <br/></i>Jesus, everybody
          was. named Kimberly, four in her class. Three guys named <br/></p>
        <p>Sean. Kimberly with her soap opera name tried to fix herself, punched all those holes in <br/>her ears trying
          to look pretty, trying to decorate herself. And Buffalo Bill looked at her <br/>sad flat tits and stuck the
          muzzle of a gun between them and blew a starfish in her chest. <br/></p>
        <p>Kimberly, her sad, fat sister who waxed her legs. No wonder--- judging from her <br/>face and her arms and
          legs, her skin was her best feature. <i>Kimberly, are you angry <br/>somewhere? </i>No senators looking out
          for her. No jets to carry crazy men around. <i>Crazy <br/></i>was a word she wasn't supposed to use. Lot of
          stuff she wasn't supposed to do. <i>Crazy <br/>men. <br/></i></p>
        <p>Starling looked at her watch. She had an hour and a half before the plane, and <br/>there was one small thing
          she could do. She wanted to look in Dr. Lecter's face when he <br/>said &quot;Billy Rubin.&quot; If she could
          stand to meet those strange maroon eyes for long enough, <br/>if she looked deeply where the dark sucks in the
          sparks, she might see something useful. <br/>She thought she might see glee. <br/></p>
        <p><i>Thank God I've still got the ID.</i> <br/>She laid twelve feet of rubber pulling out of the parking lot.

          traffic, two tears <br/></p>
        <p>of anger dried stiff on her cheeks. She felt oddly floaty and free now. An unnatural clarity <br/>in her
          vision warned her that she was inclined to fight, so she was careful of herself. </p>

      <div><p>She had passed the old courthouse earlier on her way from the airport, and she <br/>found it again without
        trouble. <br/></p>
        <p>The Tennessee authorities were taking no chances with Hannibal Lecter. They <br/>were determined to hold him
          securely without exposing him to the dangers of the city <br/>jail. <br/></p>
        <p>Their answer was the former courthouse and jail, a massive Gothic-style structure <br/>built of granite back
          when labor was free. It was a city office building now, somewhat <br/>over-restored in this prosperous,
          history-conscious town. <br/></p>
        <p>Today it looked like a medieval stronghold surrounded by police. <br/>A mix of law-enforcement cruisers---
          highway patrol, Shelby County Sheriff's <br/></p>
        <p>Department, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and Department of Corrections--- <br/>crowded the parking lot.
          There was a police post to pass before Starling even could get in <br/>to park her rented car. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter presented an additional security problem from outside. Threatening <br/>calls had been coming in
          ever since the midmorning newscasts reported his whereabouts; <br/>his victims had many friends and relatives
          who would love to see hirn dead. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling hoped the resident FBI agent, Copley, wasn't here. She didn't want to get <br/>him in trouble. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>She save the back of Chilton's head in a knot of reporters on the grass beside the <br/>main steps. There
          were two television minicams in the crowd. Starling wished her head <br/>were covered. She turned her face
          away as she approached the entrance to the tower. <br/></p>
        <p>A state trooper stationed in front of the door examined her ID card before she <br/>could go into the foyer.
          The foyer of the tower looked like a guardroom now. A city <br/>policeman was stationed at the single tower
          elevator, and another at the stairs. State <br/>troopers, the relief for the patrol units stationed around the
          building, read the <i>Commercial <br/>Appeal </i>on the couches where the public could not see them. <br/></p>
        <p>A sergeant manned the desk opposite the elevator. His name tag said TATE, C.L. <br/>&quot;No press,&quot;
          Sergeant Tate said when he saw Starling. <br/>&quot;No,&quot; she said. <br/>&quot;You with the Attorney
          General's people?&quot; he said when he looked at her card. <br/>&quot;Deputy Assistant Attorney General
          Krendler,&quot; she said. &quot;I just left him.&quot; <br/>He nodded. &quot;We've had every kind of cop in
          West Tennessee in here wanting to <br/></p>
        <p>look at Dr. Lecter. Don't see something like that very often, thank God. You'll need to <br/>talk to Dr.
          Chilton before you go up.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I saw him outside;&quot; Starling said. &quot;We were working on this in Baltimore earlier <br/>today.
          Is this where I log in, Sergeant Tate?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The sergeant briefly checked a molar with his tongue. &quot;Right there,&quot; he said. <br/>&quot;Detention
          rules, miss. Visitors check weapons, cops or not.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling nodded. She dumped the cartridges from her revolver, the sergeant glad <br/>to watch her hands move
          on the gun. She gave it to him butt first, and he locked it in his <br/>drawer. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Vernon, take her up.&quot; He dialed three digits and spoke her name into the phone. <br/>The elevator,
          an addition from the 1920s, creaked up to the top floor. It opened <br/></p>
        <p>onto a stair landing and a short corridor. <br/>&quot;Right straight across, ma'am,&quot; the trooper said.
          <br/>Painted on the frosted glass of the door was SHELBY COUNTY HISTORICAL </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>SOCIETY. <br/>Almost all the top floor of the tower was one octagonal room painted white, with <br/></p>
        <p>a floor and moldings of polished oak. It smelled of wax and library paste. With its few <br/>furnishings, the
          room had a spare, Congregational feeling. It looked better now than it <br/>ever had as a bailiff's office.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Two men in the uniform of the Tennessee Department of Corrections were on <br/>duty. The small one stood up
          at his desk when Starling came in. The bigger one sat in a <br/>folding chair at the far end of the room,
          facing the door of a cell. He was the suicide <br/>watch. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You're authorized to talk with the prisoner, ma'am?&quot; the officer at the desk said. <br/>His
          nameplate read PEMBRY, T.W. and his desk set included a telephone, two riot <br/>batons, and Chemical Mace. A
          long pinion stood in the corner behind him. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Starling said. &quot;I've questioned him before,&quot; <br/>&quot;You know the rules?
          Don't pass the barrier.&quot; <br/>&quot;Absolutely.&quot; <br/>The only color in the room was the police
          traffic barrier, a brightly striped <br/></p>
        <p>sawhorse in orange and yellow mounted with round yellow flashers, now turned off. It <br/>stood on the
          polished floor five feet in front of the cell door. On a coat tree nearby hung <br/>the doctor's things--- the
          hockey mask and something Starling had never seen before, a <br/>Kansas gallows vest. Made of heavy leather,
          with double-locking wrist shackles at the <br/>waist and buckles in the back, it may be the most infallible
          restraint garment in the world. <br/>The mask and the black vest suspended by its nape from the coat tree made
          a disturbing <br/>composition against the white wall. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling could see Dr. Lecter as she approached the cell. He was reading at a <br/>small table bolted to the
          floor. His back was to the door. He had a number of books and <br/>the copy of the running file on Buffalo
          Bill she had given him in Baltimore. A small <br/>cassette player was chained to the table leg. How strange to
          see him outside the asylum. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had seen cells like this before, as a child. They were prefabricated by a <br/>St. Louis company
          around the turn of the century, and no one has ever built them better--- <br/>a tempered steel modular cage
          that turns any room into a cell. The floor was sheet steel <br/>laid over bars, and the walls and ceiling of
          cold-forged bars completely lined the room. <br/>There was no window. The cell was spotlessly white and
          brightly lit. A flimsy paper <br/>screen stood in front of the toilet. <br/></p>
        <p>These white bars ribbed the walls. Dr. Lecter had a sleek dark head. <br/><i>He's a cemetery mink. He lives
          down in a ribcage in the dry leaves of a heart <br/></i>She blinked it away. <br/>&quot;Good morning, Clarice,&quot;
          he said without turning around. He finished his page, <br/></p>
        <p>marked his place and spun in his chair to face her, his forearms on the chair back, his chin <br/>resting on
          them. &quot;Dumas tells us that the addition of a crow to bouillon in the fall, when <br/>the crow has
          fattened on juniper berries, greatly improves the color and flavor of stock. <br/>How do <i>you </i>like it in
          the soup, Clarice?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I thought you might want your drawings, the stuff from your cell, just until you <br/>get your view.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How thoughtful. Dr. Chilton's euphoric about you and Jack Crawford being put <br/>off the case. Or did
          they send you in for one last wheedle?&quot; <br/></p>

        will say we're in love. Don't you want to ask about Billy Rubin, <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice?,&quot; <br/>&quot;Dr. Lecter, without in any way... impugning what you've told Senator Martin, <br/>
        </p>
        <p>would you advise me to go on with your idea about---&quot; <br/><i>&quot;Impugning--- </i>I<i> </i>love it. I
          wouldn't advise you at all. You tried to fool me, Clarice. <br/></p>
        <p>Do you think I'm playing with these people?&quot; <br/>&quot;I think you were telling me the truth.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it?&quot; Dr. Letter's face sank behind his arms until <br/></p>
        <p>only his eyes were visible. &quot;Pity Catherine Martin won't ever see the sun again. The sun's <br/>a
          mattress fire her God died in, Clarice.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Pity you have to pander now and lick a few tears when you can,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;It's a
          pity we didn't get to finish what we were talking about. Your idea of the imago, the <br/>structure of it, had
          a kind of... elegance that's hard to get away from. Now it's like a ruin, <br/>half an arch standing there.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Half an arch won't stand. Speaking of arches, will they still let you pound a beat, <br/>Clarice? Did
          they take your badge?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;What's that under your jacket, a watchman's clock just like Dad's?&quot; <br/>&quot;No,
          that's a speedloader.&quot; <br/>&quot;So you go around armed?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Then you
          should let your jacket out. Do you sew at all?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you make that
          costume?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked intimately with
          <br/></p>
        <p>this 'Billy Rubin' and come out knowing so little about him.&quot; <br/>&quot;You think not?&quot; <br/>&quot;If
          you met him, you know <i>everything. </i>But today you happened to remember just <br/></p>
        <p>one detail. He'd had elephant ivory anthrax. You should have seen them jump when <br/>Atlanta said it's a
          disease of knifemakers. They ate it up, just like you knew they would. <br/>You should have gotten a suite at
          the Peabody for that. Dr. Lecter, if you met him you <br/>know about him. I think maybe you didn't meet him
          and Raspail told you about him. Sec-<br/>ondhand stuff wouldn't sell as well to Senator Martin, would it?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Starling took a quick look over her shoulder. One of the officers was showing the <br/>other something in <i>Guns
          &amp; Ammo </i>magazine. &quot;You had more to tell me in Baltimore, Dr. <br/>Lecter. I believe that stuff was
          valid. Tell me the rest.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I've read the cases, Clarice, have you? Everything you need to know to find him <br/>is right there, if
          you're paying attention. Even Inspector Emeritus Crawford should have <br/>figured it out. Incidentally, did
          you read Crawford's <i>stupefying </i>speech last year to the <br/>National Police Academy? Spouting Marcus
          Aurelius on duty and honor and fortitude--- <br/>we'll see what kind of a Stoic Crawford is when Bella bites
          the big one. He copies his <br/>philosophy out of <i>Bartlett's Familiar</i>, I think. If he understood Marcus
          Aurelius, he might <br/>solve his case.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Tell me how.&quot; </p>

          covets. In fact, he covets being the very thing you are. It's his nature to covet. <br/></p>
        <p>How do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort at an <br/>answer.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No. We just---&quot; <br/>&quot;No. Precisely so. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you

          don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever <br/></p>
        <p>have.&quot; <br/>&quot;Later, listen, I'll---&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll <i>listen now. </i>Two years after your
          father's death, your mother sent you to live <br/></p>
        <p>with her cousin and her husband on a ranch in Montana. You were ten years old. You <br/>discovered they fed
          out slaughter horses. You ran away with a horse that couldn't see <br/>very well. And?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;---It was summer and we could sleep out. We got as far as Bozeman by a back <br/>road.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did the horse have a name?&quot; <br/>&quot;Probably, but they don't--- you don't find that out when
          you're feeding out <br/></p>
        <p>slaughter horses. I called her Hannah, that seemed like a good name.&quot; <br/>&quot;Were you leading her or
          riding?&quot; <br/>&quot;Some of both. I had to lead her up beside a fence to climb on.&quot; <br/>&quot;You
          rode and walked to Bozeman.&quot; <br/>&quot;There was a livery stable, dude ranch, riding academy sort of
          thing just outside <br/></p>
        <p>of town. I tried to see about them keeping her. It was twenty dollars a week in the corral. <br/>More for a
          stall. They could tell right off she couldn't see. I said okay, I'll lead her <br/>around. Little kids can sit
          on her and I'll lead her around while their parents are, you </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>know, regular riding. I can stay right here and muck out stalls. One of them, the man, <br/>agreed to
        everything I said while his wife called the sheriff.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;The sheriff was a policeman, like your father.&quot; <br/>&quot;That didn't keep me from being scared
          of him, at first. He had a big red face. The <br/></p>
        <p>sheriff finally put up twenty dollars for a week's board while he 'straightened things out.' <br/>He said
          there was no use going for the stall in warm weather. The papers picked it up. <br/>There was a flap. My
          mother's cousin agreed to let me go. I wound up going to the <br/>Lutheran Home in Bozeman.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;It's an orphanage?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;And Hannah?&quot; <br/>&quot;She went too. A
          big Lutheran rancher put up the hay. They already had a barn at <br/></p>
        <p>the orphanage. We plowed the garden with her. You had to watch where she was going, <br/>though. She'd walk
          through the butter-bean trellises and step on any kind of plant that <br/>was too short for her to feel it
          against her legs. And we led her around pulling kids in a <br/>cart.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;She died though.&quot; <br/>&quot;Well, yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Tell me about that.&quot; <br/>&quot;It
          was last year, they wrote me at school. They think she was about twenty-two. <br/></p>
        <p>Pulled a cart full of kids the last day she lived, and died in her sleep.&quot; <br/>Dr. Lecter seemed
          disappointed. &quot;How heartwarming,&quot; he said. &quot;Did your foster <br/></p>
        <p>father in Montana fuck you, Clarice?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did he try?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;What made you run away with the horse?&quot;' <br/>&quot;They were going to kill her.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did
          you know when?&quot; <br/>&quot;Not exactly. I worried about it all the time. She was getting pretty fat.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;What triggered you then? What set you off on that particular day?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't know.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I think you do.&quot; <br/>&quot;I had worried about it all the time.&quot; <br/>&quot;What set you
          off, Clarice? You started what time?&quot; <br/>&quot;Early. Still dark.&quot; <br/>&quot;Then something woke
          you. What woke you up? Did you dream? What was it?&quot; <br/>&quot;I woke up and heard the lambs screaming. I
          woke up in the dark and the lambs <br/></p>
        <p>were screaming.&quot; <br/>&quot;'They were slaughtering the spring lambs?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;What
          did you do?&quot; <br/>&quot;I couldn't do anything for them. I was just a---&quot; <br/>&quot;What did you do
          with the <i>horse?&quot;</i> <br/>&quot;I got dressed without turning on the light and went outside. She was
          scared. All <br/></p>
        <p>the horses in the pen were scared and milling around. I blew in her nose and she knew it </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>was me. Finally she'd put her nose in my hand. The lights were on in the barn and in the <br/>shed by the
        sheep pen. Bare bulbs, big shadows. The refrigefator truck had come and it <br/>was idling, roaring. I led her
        away.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did you saddle her?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. I didn't take their saddle. Just a rope hackamore was all.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;As you went off in the dark, could you hear the lambs back where the lights <br/></p>
        <p>were?&quot; <br/>&quot;Not long. There weren't but twelve.&quot; <br/>&quot;You still wake up sometimes,
          don't you? Wake up in the iron dark with the <br/></p>
        <p>lambs screaming?&quot; <br/>&quot;Sometimes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you think if you caught Buffalo Bill
          yourself and if you made Catherine all <br/></p>
        <p>right, you could make the lambs stop screaming, do you think they'd be all right too and <br/>you wouldn't
          wake up again in the dark and hear the lambs screaming? Clarice?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes. I don't know. Maybe.&quot; <br/>&quot;Thank you, Clarice.&quot; Dr. Lecter seemed oddly at peace.
          <br/>&quot;Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter, &quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;Dr. Chilton,&quot; Lecter said,
          &quot;I believe you know each other.&quot; <br/>For an instant, Starling didn't realize Chilton was behind
          her. Then he took her <br/></p>
        <p>elbow. <br/>She took it back, Officer Pembry and his big partner were with Chilton. <br/>&quot;In the

          degree?&quot; Dr. Lecter said. &quot;Please bear <br/></p>
        <p>that in mind later on.&quot; <br/>&quot;Let's go,&quot; Chilton said. <br/>&quot;You're not in charge here,
          Dr. Chilton,&quot; Starling said. <br/>Officer Pembry came around Chilton. &quot;No, ma'am, but I am. He
          called my boss <br/></p>
        <p>and your boss both. I'm sorry, but I've got orders to see you out. Come on with me, now.&quot; <br/>&quot;Good-bye,
          Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>Pembry was
          taking her arm. It was go or fight him. <br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll tell you.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do
          you promise?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Then why not finish the arch? Take your case file with
          you, Clarice, I won't need <br/></p>
        <p>it anymore.&quot; He held it at arm's length. through the bars, his forefinger along the spine. <br/>She
          reached across the barrier and took it. For an instant the tip of her forefinger touched <br/>Dr. Lecter's.
          The touch crackled in his eyes. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Thank you, Clarice.&quot; <br/>&quot;Thank you, Dr. Lecter.&quot; <br/>And that is how he remained in
          Starling's mind. Caught in the instant when he did <br/></p>
        <p>not mock. Standing in his white cell, arched like a dancer, his hands clasped in front of <br/>him and his
          head slightly to the side. <br/></p>
        <p>She went over a speed bump at the airport fast enough to bang her head on the <br/>roof of the car, and had
          to run for the airplane Krendler had ordered her to catch. <br/></p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p><b> <br/>CHAPTER 36 <br/> <br/>O</b>fficers Pembry and Boyle were experienced men brought especially from
        <br/></p>
        <p>Brushy Mountain State Prison to be Dr. Lecter's warders. They were calm and careful <br/>and did not feel
          they needed their job explained to them by Dr. Chilton. <br/></p>
        <p>They had arrived in Memphis ahead of Lecter and examined the cell minutely. <br/>When Dr. Lecter was brought
          to the old courthouse, they examined him as well. He was <br/>subjected to an internal body search by a male
          nurse while, he was still in restraints. His <br/>clothing was searched thoroughly and a metal detector run
          over the seams. <br/></p>
        <p>Boyle and Pembry came to an understanding with him, speaking in low, civil <br/>tones close to his ears as he
          was examined. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter, we can get along just fine. We'll treat you just as good as you treat us. <br/>Act like a
          gentleman and you get the Eskimo Pie. But we're not pussyfooting around with <br/>you, buddy. Try to bite, and
          we'll leave you smooth-mouthed. Looks like you got <br/>something good going here. You don't want to fuck it
          up, do you?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter crinkled his eyes at them in a friendly fashion. If he had been inclined <br/>to reply he would
          have been prevented by the wooden peg between his molars as the <br/>nurse shined a flashlight in his mouth
          and ran a gloved finger into his cheeks. <br/></p>
        <p>The metal detector beeped at his cheeks. <br/>&quot;What's that?&quot; the nurse asked. <br/>&quot;Fillings,&quot;
          Pembry said. &quot;Pull his lip back there. You've put some miles on them <br/></p>
        <p>back ones, haven't you, Doc?&quot; <br/>&quot;Strikes me he's pretty much of a broke-dick,&quot; Boyle
          confided to Pembry after <br/></p>
        <p>they had Dr. Lecter secure in his cell. &quot;He won't be no trouble if he don't flip out.&quot; <br/>The
          cell, while secure and strong, lacked a rolling food carrier. At lunchtime, in <br/></p>
        <p>the unpleasant atmosphere that followed Starling's visit, Dr. Chilton inconvenienced <br/>everyone, making
          Boyle and Pembry go through the long process of securing the <br/>compliant Dr. Lecter in the straitjacket and
          leg restraints as he stood with his back to the <br/>bars, Chilton poised with the Mace, before they opened
          the door to carry in his tray. <br/></p>
        <p>Chilton refused to use Boyle's and Pembry's names, though they wore nameplates, <br/>and addressed them
          indiscriminately as &quot;you, there.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>For their part, after the warders heard Chilton was not a real M.D., Boyle <br/>observed to Pembry that he
          was just &quot;some kind of a God damned schoolteacher.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Pembry tried once to explain to Chilton that Starling's visit had been approved not <br/>by them but by the
          desk downstairs, and saw that in Chilton's anger it didn't matter. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Chilton was absent at supper and, with Dr. Lecter's bemused cooperation, <br/>Boyle and Pembry used their
          own method to take in his tray. It worked very well. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter, you not gonna be needing your dinner jacket tonight,&quot; Peinbry said. <br/>&quot;I'll
          ask you to sit on the floor and scoot backwards till you can just stick your hands out <br/>through the bars,
          arms extended backward. There you go. Scoot up a little and straighten <br/>'em out more behind you, elbows
          straight.&quot; Pembry handcuffed Dr. Lecter tightly outside <br/>the bars, with a bar between his arms, and a
          low crossbar above them. &quot;That hurts just a <br/>little bit, don't it? I know it does and they won't be
          on there but a minute, save us both a <br/>lot of trouble.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter could not rise, even to a squat, and with his legs straight in front of him </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>on the floor, he couldn't kick. <br/>Only when Dr. Lecter was pinioned did Pembry return to the desk for
        the key to <br/></p>
        <p>the cell door. Pembry slid his riot baton in the ring at his waist, put a canister of Mace in <br/>his
          pocket, and returned to the cell. He opened the door while Boyle took in the tray. <br/>When the door was
          secured, Pembry took the key back to the desk before he took the <br/>cuffs off Dr. Lecter. At no time was he
          near the bars with the key while the doctor was <br/>free in the cell. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Now that was pretty easy, wasn't it?&quot; Pembry said. <br/>&quot;It was very convenient, thank you,
          Officer,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. &quot;You know, I'm just <br/></p>
        <p>trying to get by.&quot; <br/>&quot;We all are, brother,&quot; Pembry said. <br/>Dr. Lecter toyed with his
          food while he wrote and drew and doodled on his pad <br/></p>
        <p>with a felt-tipped pen. He flipped over the cassette in the tape player chained to the table <br/>leg and
          punched the play button. Glenn Gould playing Bach's <i>Goldberg Variations</i> on the <br/>piano. The music,
          beautiful beyond plight and time, filled the bright cage and the room <br/>where the warders sat. <br/></p>
        <p>For Dr. Lecter, sitting still at the table, time slowed and spread as it does in action. <br/>For him the
          notes of music moved apart without losing tempo. Even Back's silver <br/>pounces were discrete notes
          glittering off the steel around him. Dr. Lecter rose, his <br/>expression abstracted, and watched his paper
          napkin slide off his thighs to the floor. The <br/>napkin was in the air a long time, brushed the table leg,
          flared, sideslipped, stalled and <br/>turned over before it came to rest on the steel floor. He made no effort
          to pick it up, but <br/>took a stroll across his cell, went behind the paper screen and sat on the lid of his
          toilet, <br/>his only private place. Listening to the music, he leaned sideways on the sink, his chin in <br/>his
          hand, his strange maroon eyes half-closed. The <i>Goldberg Variations</i> interested him <br/>structurally.
          Here it came again, the bass progression from the saraband repeated, <br/>repeated. He nodded along, his
          tongue moving over the edges of his teeth. All the way <br/>around on top, all the way around on the bottom.
          It was a long and interesting trip for his <br/>tongue, like a good walk in the Alps. <br/></p>
        <p>He did his gums now, sliding his tongue high in the crevice between his cheek <br/>and gum and moving it
          slowly around as some men do when ruminating. His gums were <br/>cooler than his tongue. It was cool up in the
          crevice. When his tongue got to the little <br/>metal tube, it stopped. <br/></p>
        <p>Over the music he heard the elevator clank and whir as it started up. Many notes <br/>of music later, the
          elevator door opened and a voice he did not know said, &quot;I'm s'posed to <br/>get the tray.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter heard the smaller one coming, Pernbry. He could see through the crack <br/>between the panels in
          his screen. Pembry was at the bars. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Lecter. Come sit on the floor with your back to the bars like we did before.&quot; <br/>&quot;Officer
          Pembry, would you mind if I just finish up here? I'm afraid my trip's <br/></p>
        <p>gotten my digestion a little out of sorts.&quot; It took a very long time to say. <br/>&quot;All right.&quot;
          Pembry calling down the room, &quot;We'll call down when we got it.&quot; <br/>&quot;Can I look at him?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;We'll call you.&quot; <br/>The elevator again and then only the music. <br/>Dr. Lecter took the
          tube from his mouth and dried it on a piece of toilet tissue. His </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>hands were steady, his palms perfectly dry. <br/>In his years of detention, with his unending curiosity,
        Dr. Lecter had learned <br/></p>
        <p>many of the secret prison crafts. In all the years after he savaged the nurse in the <br/>Baltimore asylum,
          there had been only two lapses in the security around him, both on <br/>Barney's days off. Once a psychiatric
          researcher loaned him a ballpoinf pen and then <br/>forgot it. Before the man was out of the ward, Dr. Lecter
          had broken up the plastic barrel <br/>of the pen and flushed it down his toilet. The metal ink tube went in
          the rolled seam <br/>edging his mattress. <br/></p>
        <p>The only sharp edge in his cell at the asylum was a burr on the head of a bolt <br/>holding his cot to the
          wall. It was enough. In two months of rubbing, Dr. Lecter cut the <br/>required two incisions, parallel and a
          quarter-inch, long, running along the tube from its <br/>open end. Then he cut the ink tube in two pieces one
          inch from the open end and flushed <br/>the long piece with the point down the toilet. Barney did not spot the
          calluses on his <br/>fingers from the nights of rubbing. <br/></p>
        <p>Six months later, an orderly left a heavy-duty paper clip on some documents sent <br/>to Dr. Letter by his
          attorney. One inch of the steel clip went inside the tube and the rest <br/>went down the toilet. The little
          tube, smooth and short, was easy to conceal in seams of <br/>clothing, between the cheek and gum, in the
          rectum. <br/></p>
        <p>Now, behind his paper screen, Dr. Letter tapped the little metal tube on his <br/>thumbnail until the wire
          inside it slipped out. The wire was a tool and this was the <br/>difficult part. Dr. Lecter stuck the wire
          halfway into the little tube and with infinite care <br/>used it as a lever to bend down the strip of metal
          between the two incisions. Sometimes <br/>they break. Carefully, with his powerful hands, he bent the metal
          and it was coming. <br/>Now. The minute strip of metal was at right angles to the tube. Now, he had a handcuff
          <br/>key. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter put his hands behind him and passed the key back and forth between <br/>them fifteen times. He put
          the key back in his mouth while he washed his hands and <br/>meticulously dried them. Then, with his tongue,
          he hid the key between the fingers of his <br/>right hand, knowing Pembry would stare at his strange left hand
          when it was behind his <br/>back. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm ready when you are, Officer Pembry,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. He sat on the floor of <br/>the cell and
          stretched his arms behind him, his hands and wrists through the bars. &quot;Thank <br/>you for waiting.&quot;
          It seemed a long speech, but it was leavened by the music. <br/></p>
        <p>He heard Pembry behind him now. Pembry felt his wrist to see if he had soaped it. <br/>Pembry felt his other
          wrist to see if he had soaped it. Pembry put the cuffs on tight. He <br/>went back to the desk for the key to
          the cell. Over the piano, Dr. Lecter heard the clink of <br/>the key ring as Pembry took it from the desk
          drawer. Now he was coming back, walking <br/>through the notes, parting the air that swarmed with crystal
          notes. This time Boyle came <br/>back with him. Dr. Lecter could hear the holes they made in the echoes of the
          music. <br/></p>
        <p>Pembry checked the cuffs again. Dr. Lecter could smell Petnbry's breath behind <br/>him. Now Pembry unlocked
          the cell and swung the door open. Boyle came in. Dr. Lecter <br/>turned his head, the cell moving by his
          vision at a rate that seemed slow to him, the <br/>details wonderfully sharp--- Boyle at the table gathering
          the scattered supper things onto <br/>the tray with a clatter of annoyance at the mess. The tape player with
          its reels turning, the <br/>napkin on the floor beside the bolted-down leg of the table. Through the bars, Dr.
          Lecter <br/>saw in the corner of his eye the back of Pembry's knee, the tip of the baton hanging from </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>his belt as he stood outside the cell holding the door. <br/>Dr. Lecter found the keyhole in his left
        cuff, inserted the key and turned it. He felt <br/></p>
        <p>the cuff spring loose on his wrist. He passed the key to his left hand, found the keyhole, <br/>put in the
          key and turned it. <br/></p>
        <p>Boyle bent for the napkin on the floor. Fast as a snapping turtle the handcuff <br/>closed on Boyle's wrist
          and as he turned his rolling eye to Lecter the other cuff locked <br/>around the fixed leg of the table. Dr.
          Lecter's legs under him now, driving to the door, <br/>Pembry trying to come from behind it and Lecter's
          shoulder drove the iron door into him, <br/>Pembry going for the Mace in his belt, his arm mashed to his body
          by the door. Lecter <br/>grabbed the long end of the baton and lifted. With the leverage twisting Pembry's
          belt <br/>tight around him, he hit Pembry in the throat with his elbow and sank his teeth in <br/>Pembry's
          face. Pembry trying to claw at Lecter, his nose and upper lip caught between <br/>the tearing teeth. Lecter
          shook his head like a rat-killing dog and pulled the riot baton <br/>from Pembry's belt. In the cell Boyle
          bellowing now, sitting on the floor, digging <br/>desperately in his pocket for his handcuff key, fumbling,
          dropping it, finding it again. <br/>Lecter drove the end of the baton into Pembry's stomach and throat and he
          went to his <br/>knees. Boyle got the key in a lock of the handcuffs, he was bellowing, Lecter coming to <br/>him
          now. Lecter shut Boyle up with a shot of the Mace and as he wheezed, cracked his <br/>upstretched arm with two
          blows of the baton. Boyle tried to get under the table, but <br/>blinded by the Mace he crawled the wrong way
          and it was easy, with five judicious <br/>blows, to beat him to death. <br/></p>
        <p>Pembry had managed to sit up and he was crying. Dr. Lecter looked down at him <br/>with his red smile. &quot;I'm
          ready if you are, Officer Pembry,&quot; he said. <br/></p>
        <p>The baton, whistling in a flat arc, caught Pembry <i>pock </i>on the back of the head and <br/>he shivered
          out straight like a clubbed fish. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter's pulse was elevated to more than one hundred by the exercise, but <br/>quickly slowed to normal.
          He turned off the music and listened. <br/></p>
        <p>He went to the stairs and listened again. He turned out Pembry's pockets, got the <br/>desk key and opened
          all its drawers. In the bottom drawer were Boyle's and Pembry's <br/>duty weapons, a pair of .38 Special
          revolvers. Even better, in Boyle's pocket he found a <br/>pocket knife. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 37 <br/> <br/>T</b>he lobby was full of policemen. It was 6:30 P.M. and the police at
          the outside <br/></p>
        <p>guard posts had just been relieved at their regular two-hour interval. The men coming <br/>into the lobby
          from the raw evening warmed their hands at several electric heaters. Some <br/>of them had money down on the
          Memphis State basketball game in progress and were <br/>anxious to know how it was going. <br/></p>
        <p>Sergeant Tate would not allow a radio to be played aloud in the lobby, but one <br/>officer had a Walkman
          plugged in his ear. He reported the score often, but not often <br/>enough to suit the bettors. <br/></p>
        <p>In all there were fifteen armed policemen in the lobby plus two Corrections <br/>officers set to relieve
          Pembry and Boyle at 7:00 P.M. Sergeant Tate himself was looking <br/>forward to going off duty with the
          eleven-to-seven shift. </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>All posts reported quiet. None of the nut calls threatening Lecter had come to <br/>anything. <br/></p>
        <p>At 6:45, Tate heard the elevator start up. He saw the bronze arrow above the door <br/>begin to crawl around
          the dial. It stopped at five. <br/></p>
        <p>Tate looked around the'lobby. &quot;Did Sweeney go up for the tray?&quot; <br/>&quot;Naw, I'm here, Sarge.
          You mind calling, see if they're through? I need to get <br/></p>
        <p>going.&quot; <br/>Sergeant Tate dialed three digits and listened. &quot;Phone's busy,&quot; he said. &quot;Go

        <p>up and see.&quot; He turned back to the log he was completing for the eleven-to-seven shift. <br/>Patrolman
          Sweeney pushed the elevator button. It didn't come. <br/>&quot;Had to have <i>lamb chops </i>tonight, rare,&quot;
          Sweeney said. &quot;What you reckon he'll <br/></p>
        <p>want for breakfast, some fucking thing from the zoo? And who'll have to catch it for him? <br/>Sweeney.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>The bronze arrow above the door stayed on five. <br/>Sweeney waited another minute. &quot;What <i>is </i>this
          shit?&quot; he said. <br/>The .38 boomed somewhere above them, the reports echoing down the stone <br/></p>
        <p>stairs, two fast shots and then a third. <br/>Sergeant Tate, on his feet at the third one, microphone in his
          hand. &quot;CP, shots <br/></p>
        <p>fired upstairs at the tower. Outside posts look sharp. We're going up.&quot; <br/>Yelling, milling in the
          lobby. <br/>Tate saw the bronze arrow of the elevator moving then. It was already down to <br/></p>
        <p>four. Tate roared over the racket, &quot;Hold it! Guard mount double up at your outside posts, <br/>first
          squad stays with me. Berry and Howard cover that fucking elevator if it comes---&quot; <br/>The needle stopped
          at three. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;First squad, here we go. Don't pass a door without checking it. Bobby, outside--- <br/>get a shotgun
          and the vests and bring 'em up.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Tate's mind was racing on the first flight of stairs. Caution fought with the terrible <br/>need to help the
          officers upstairs.<i> God don't let him be out Nobody weasing vests, shit. <br/>Fucking Corrections screws.
            <br/></i></p>
        <p>The offices on two, three and four were supposed to be empty and locked. You <br/>could get from the tower to
          the main building on those floors, if you went through the <br/>offices. You couldn't on five. <br/></p>
        <p>Tate had been to the excellent Tennessee SWAT school and he knew how to do it. <br/>He went first and took
          the young ones in hand. Fast and careful they took the stairs, <br/>covering each other from landing to
          landing. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You turn your back on a door before you check it, I'll ream your ass.&quot; <br/>The doors off the
          second-floor landing were dark and locked. <br/>Up to three now, the little corridor dim. One rectangle of
          light on the floor from <br/></p>
        <p>the open elevator car. Tate moved down the wall opposite the open elevator, no mirrors <br/>in the car to
          help him. With two pounds' pressure on a nine-pound trigger, he looked <br/>inside the car. Empty. <br/></p>
        <p>Tate yelled up the stairs, <i>&quot;Boyle! Pembry! </i>Shit.&quot; He posted a man on three and <br/>moved
          up. <br/></p>
        <p>Four was flooded with the music of the piano coming from above. The door into <br/>the offices opened at a
          push. Beyond the offices, the beam of the long flashlight shined <br/>on a door open wide into the great dark
          building beyond. </p>

          HISTORICAL SOCIETY. <br/></p>
        <p>Tate moved low beneath the door glass to the side opposite the hinges. He nodded <br/>to Jacobs on the other
          side, turned the knob and shoved hard, the door swinging all the <br/>way back hard enough for the glass to
          shatter, Tate inside fast and out of the doorframe, <br/>covering the room over the wide sights of his
          revolver. <br/></p>
        <p>Tate had seen many things. He had seen accidents beyond reckoning, fights, <br/>murders. He had seen six dead
          policemen in his time. But he thought that what lay at his <br/>feet was the worst thing he had ever seen
          happen to an officer. The meat above the <br/>uniform collar no longer resembled a face. The front and top of
          the head were a slick of <br/>blood peaked with torn flesh and a single eye was stuck beside the nostrils, the
          sockets <br/>full of blood. <br/></p>
        <p>Jacobs passed Tate, slipping on the bloody floor as he went in to the cell. He bent <br/>over Boyle, still
          handcuffed to the table leg. Boyle partly, eviscerated, his face hacked to <br/>pieces, seemed to have
          exploded blood in the cell, the walls and the stripped cot covered <br/>with gouts and splashes. <br/></p>
        <p>Jacobs put his fingers on the neck. &quot;This one's dead,&quot; he called over the music. <br/>&quot;Sarge?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Tate, back at himself, ashamed of a second's lapse, and he was talking into his <br/>radio. &quot;Command
          post, two officers down. Repeat, two officers down. Prisoner is <br/>missing. Lecter is missing. Outside posts
          watch the windows, subject has stripped the <br/>bed, he may be making a rope. Confirm ambulances en route.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Pembry dead, Sarge?&quot; Jacobs shut the music off. <br/>Tate knelt and as he reached for the neck to
          feel, the awful thing on the floor <br/></p>
        <p>groaned and blew a bloody bubble. <br/>&quot;Pembry's alive.&quot; Tate didn't want to put his mouth in the
          bloody mess, knew he <br/></p>
        <p>would if he had to help Pembry breathe, knew he wouldn't make one of the patrolmen do <br/>it. Better if
          Pembry died, but he would help him breathe. But there was a heartbeat, he <br/>found it, there was breathing.
          It was ragged and gurgling but it was breathing. The ruin <br/>was breathing on its own. <br/></p>
        <p>Tate's radio crackled. A patrol lieutenant set up on the lot outside took command <br/>and wanted news. Tate
          had to talk. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Come here, Murray,&quot; Tate called to a young patrolman. &quot;Get down here with <br/>Pembry and
          take ahold of him where he can feel your hands on him. Talk to him. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What's his name, Sarge?&quot; Murray was green. <br/>&quot;It's Pembry, now talk to him, God dammit.&quot;
          Tate on the radio. &quot;Two officers <br/></p>
        <p>down, Boyle's dead and Pembry's bad hurt. Lecter's missing and armed--- he took their <br/>guns. Belts and
          holsters are on the desk.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The lieutenant's voice was scratchy through the thick walls. &quot;Can you confirm the <br/>stairway clear
          for stretchers?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes sir. Call up to four before they pass. I have men on every landing.&quot; <br/>&quot;Roger,
          Sergeant. Post Eight out here thought he saw some movement behind the <br/></p>
        <p>windows in the main building on four. We've got the exits covered, he's not getting out. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Hold your positions on the landings. SWAT's rolling. We're gonna let SWAT flush him <br/>out. Confirm.&quot;
        <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I understand. SWAT's play.&quot; <br/>&quot;What's he got?&quot; <br/>&quot;Two pistols and a knife,
          Lieutenant--- Jacobs, see if there's any ammo in the <br/></p>
        <p>gunbelts.&quot; <br/>&quot;Dump pouches,&quot; the patrolman said. &quot;Pembry's still full, Boyle's too.
          Dumb shit <br/></p>
        <p>didn't take the extra rounds.&quot; <br/>&quot;What are they?&quot; <br/>&quot;Thirty-eight +Ps JHP.&quot;
          <br/>Tate was back on the radio. &quot;Lieutenant, it looks like he's got two six-shot .38s. <br/></p>
        <p>We heard three rounds fired and the dump pouches on the gunbelts are still full, so he <br/>may just have
          nine left. Advise SWAT it's +Ps jacketed hollowpoints. This guy favors the <br/>face.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Plus Ps were hot rounds, but they would not penetrate SWATs body armor. A hit <br/>in the face would very
          likely be fatal, a hit on a limb would maim. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Stretchers coming up, Tate.&quot; <br/>The ambulances were there amazingly fast, but it did not seem
          fast enough to <br/></p>
        <p>Tate, listening to the pitiful thing at his feet. Young Murray was trying to hold the <br/>groaning, jerking
          body, trying to talk reassuringly and not look at him, and he was <br/>saying, &quot;You're just fine, Pembry,
          looking good,&quot; over and over in the same sick tone. <br/></p>
        <p>As soon as he saw the ambulance attendants on the landing, Tate yelled, <br/>&quot;Corpsman!&quot; as he had
          in war. <br/></p>
        <p>He got Murray by the shoulder and moved him out of the way. The ambulance <br/>attendants worked fast,
          expertly securing the clenched, blood-slick fists under the belt, <br/>getting an airway in and peeling a
          nonstick surgical bandage to get some pressure on the <br/>bloody face and head. One of them popped an
          intravenous plasma pack, but the other, <br/>taking blood pressure and pulse, shook his head and said, &quot;Downstairs.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Orders on the radio now. &quot;rate, I want you to clear the offices in the tower and <br/>seal it off.
          Secure the doors from the main building. Then cover from the landings. I'm <br/>sending up vests and shotguns.
          We'll get him alive if he wants to come, but we take no <br/>special risks to preserve his life. Understand
          me?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I got it, Lieutenant.&quot; <br/>&quot;I want SWAT and nobody but SWAT in the main building. Let me
          have that <br/></p>
        <p>back.&quot; <br/>Tate repeated the order. <br/>Tate was a good sergeant and he showed it now as he and Jacobs
          shrugged into <br/></p>
        <p>their heavy armored vests and followed the gurney as the orderlies carried it down the <br/>stairs to the
          ambulance. A second crew followed with Boyle. The men on the landings <br/>were angry, seeing the gurneys
          pass, and Tate had a word of wisdom for them: &quot;Don't let <br/>your temper get your ass shot off.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>As the sirens wailed outside, Tate, backed by the veteran Jacobs, carefully cleared <br/>the offices and
          sealed off the tower. <br/></p>
        <p>A cool draft blew down the hall on four. Beyond the door, in the vast dark spaces <br/>of the main building,
          the telephones were ringing. In dark offices all over the building, <br/>buttons on telephones were winking
          like fireflies, the bells sounding over and over. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>The word was out that Dr. Lecter was &quot;barricaded&quot; in the building, and radio and <br/>television
        reporters were calling, dialing fast with their modems, trying to get live <br/>interviews with the monster. To
        avoid this, SWAT usually has the telephones shut off, <br/>except for one that the negotiator uses. This
        building was too big, the offices too many. <br/></p>
        <p>Tate closed and locked the door on the rooms of blinking telephones. His chest <br/>and back were wet and
          itching under the hardshell vest. <br/></p>
        <p>He took his radio off his belt. &quot;CP, this is Tate, the towers clear, over.&quot; <br/>&quot;Roger, Tate.
          Captain wants you at the CP.&quot; <br/>&quot;Ten-four. Tower lobby, you there?&quot; <br/>&quot;Here, Sarge.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;It's me on the elevator, I'm bringing it down.&quot; <br/>&quot;Gotcha, Sarge.&quot; <br/>Jacobs
          and Tate were in the elevator riding down to the lobby when a drop of <br/></p>
        <p>blood fell on Tate's shoulder. Another hit his shoe. <br/>He looked at the ceiling of the car, touched
          Jacobs, motioning for silence. <br/>Blood was dripping from the crack around the service hatch in the top of
          the car. <br/></p>
        <p>It seemed a long ride down to the lobby. Tate and Jacobs stepped off backwards, guns <br/>pointed at the
          ceiling of the elevator. Tate reached back in and locked the car. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Shhhh, &quot; Tate said in the lobby. Quietly, &quot;Berry, Howard, he's on the roof of the <br/>elevator.
          Keep it covered.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Tate went outside. The black SWAT van was on the lot. SWAT always had a <br/>variety of elevator keys. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>They were set up in moments, two SWAT officers in black body armor and <br/>headsets climbing the stairs to
          the third-floor landing. With Tate in the lobby were two <br/>more, their assault rifles pointed at the
          elevator ceiling. <br/></p>
        <p><i>Like the big ants that fight, </i>Tate thought. <br/>The SWAT commander was talking into his headset.
          &quot;Okay, Johnny.&quot; <br/>On the third floor, high above the elevator, Officer Johnny Peterson turned his
          <br/></p>
        <p>key in the lock and the elevator door slid open. The shaft was dark. Lying on his back in <br/>the corridor,
          he took a stun grenade from his tactical vest and put it on the floor beside <br/>him. &quot;Okay, I'll take a
          look now.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>He took out his mirror with its long handle and stuck it over the edge while his <br/>partner shined a
          powerful flashlight down the shaft. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I see him. He's on top of the elevator. I see a weapon beside him. He's not <br/>moving.&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>The question in Peterson's earphone, &quot;Can you see his hands?&quot; <br/>&quot;I see one hand, the other
          one's under him. He's got the sheets around him.&quot; <br/>&quot;Tell him.&quot; <br/>&quot;PUT YOUR HANDS ON
          TOP OF YOUR HEAD AND FREEZE,&quot; Peterson <br/></p>
        <p>yelled down the shaft. &quot;He didn't move, Lieutenant... Right.&quot; <br/>&quot;IF YOU DON'T PUT YOUR
          HANDS ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD I'LL DROP <br/></p>
        <p>A STUN GRENADE ON YOU. I'LL GIVE YOU THREE SECONDS,&quot; Peterson called. <br/>He took from his vest one of
          the doorstops every SWAT officer carries. &quot;OKAY, GUYS, <br/>WATCH OUT DOWN THERE--- HERE COMES THE
          GRENADE.&quot; He dropped the <br/>doorstop over the edge, saw it bounce on the figure. &quot;He didn't move,
          Lieutenant.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Okay, Johnny, we're gonna push the hatch up with a pole from outside the car. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Can you get the drop?&quot; <br/>Peterson rolled over. His .45 automatic, cocked and locked, pointed
        straight down <br/></p>
        <p>at the figure. &quot;Got the drop,&quot; he said. <br/>Looking down the elevator shaft, Peterson could see
          the crack of light appear <br/></p>
        <p>below as the officers in the foyer pushed up on the hatch with a SWAT boathook. The <br/>still figure was
          partly over the hatch and one of the arms moved as the officers pushed <br/>from below. <br/></p>
        <p>Peterson's thumb pressed a shade harder on the safety of the Colt. &quot;His arm <br/>moved, Lieutenant, but
          I think it's just the hatch moving it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Roger. Heave.&quot; <br/>The hatch banged backward and lay against the wall of the elevator shaft. It
          was <br/></p>
        <p>hard for Peterson to look down into the light. &quot;He hasn't moved. His hand's <i>not </i>on the <br/>weapon.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>The calm voice in his ear, &quot;Okay, Johnny, hold up. We're coming into the car, so <br/>watch. with the
          mirror for movement. Any fire will come from us. Affirm?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Got it.&quot; <br/>In the lobby, Tate watched them go into the car. A rifleman loaded with armor-<br/>
        </p>
        <p>piercing aimed his weapon at the ceiling of the elevator. A second officer climbed on a <br/>ladder. He was
          armed with a large automatic pistol with a flashlight clamped beneath it. <br/>A mirror and the pistol-light
          went up through the hatch. Then the officer's head and <br/>shoulders. He handed down a .38 revolver. &quot;He's
          dead,&quot; the officer called down. <br/></p>
        <p>Tate wondered if the death of Dr. Lecter meant Catherine Martin would die too, <br/>all the information lost
          when the lights went out in that monster mind. <br/></p>
        <p>The officers were pulling him down now, the body coming upside down through <br/>the elevator hatch, eased
          down into many arms, an odd deposition in a lighted box. The <br/>lobby was filling up, policemen crowding up
          to see. <br/></p>
        <p>A corrections officer pushed forward, looked at the body's outflung tattooed arms. <br/>&quot;That's Pembry,&quot;
          he said. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 38 <br/> <br/>I</b>n the back of the howling ambulance, the young
          attendant braced himself against <br/></p>
        <p>the sway and turned to his radio to report to his emergency room supervisor, talking loud <br/>above the
          siren. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He's comatose but the vital signs are good. He's got good pressure. One-thirty <br/>over ninety. Yeah,
          ninety. Pulse eighty-five. He's got severe facial cuts with elevated <br/>flaps, one eye enucleated. I've got
          pressure on the face and an airway in place. Possible <br/>gunshot in the head, I can't tell.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Behind him on the stretcher, the balled and bloody fists relax inside the <br/>waistband. The right hand
          slides out, finds the buckle on the strap across the chest. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm scared to put much pressure on the head--- he showed some convulsive <br/>movement before we put
          him on the gurney. Yeah, got him in the Fowler position.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Behind the young man, the hand gripped the surgical bandage and wiped out the <br/>eyes. <br/></p>
        <p>The attendant heard the airway hiss close behind him, turned and saw the bloody </p>

      <div><p>face in his, did not see the pistol descending and it caught him hard over the ear. <br/>The ambulance
        slowing to a stop in traffic on the six-lane freeway, drivers behind <br/></p>
        <p>it confused and honking, hesitant to pull around an emergency vehicle. Two small pops <br/>like backfires in
          the traffic and the ambulance started up again, weaving, straightening <br/>out, moving to the right lane.
          <br/></p>
        <p>The airport exit coming up. The ambulance piddled along in the right lane, <br/>various emergency lights
          going on and off on the outside of it, wipers on and off, then the <br/>siren wailing down, starting up,
          wailing down to silence and the flashing lights going off. <br/>The ambulance proceeding quietly, taking the
          exit to Memphis International Airport, the <br/>beautiful building floodlit in the winter evening. It took the
          curving drive as far as the <br/>automated gates to the vast underground parking field. A bloody hand came out
          to take a <br/>ticket. And the ambulance disappeared down the tunnel to the parking field beneath the <br/>ground.
          <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 39 <br/> <br/>N</b>ormally, Clarice Starling would have been curious to see Crawford's
          house in <br/></p>
        <p>Arlington, but the bulletin on the car radio about Dr. Lecter's escape knocked all that out <br/>of her.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Lips numb and scalp prickling, she drove by rote, saw the neat 1950s ranch house <br/>without looking at it,
          and only wondered dimly if the lit, curtained windows on the left <br/>were where Bella was lying. The
          doorbell seemed too loud. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford opened the door on the second ring. He wore a baggy cardigan and he <br/>was talking on a wireless
          phone. &quot;Copley in Memphis,&quot; he said. Motioning for her to <br/>follow, he led her through the house,
          grunting into the telephone as he went. <br/></p>
        <p>In the kitchen, a nurse took a tiny bottle from the refrigerator and held it to the <br/>light. When Crawford
          raised his eyebrows to the nurse, she shook her head, she didn't <br/>need him. <br/></p>
        <p>He took Starling to his study, down three steps into what was clearly a converted <br/>double garage. There
          was good space here, a sofa and chairs, and on the cluttered desk a <br/>computer terminal glowed green beside
          an antique astrolabe. The rug felt as though it <br/>was laid on concrete. Crawford waved her to a seat. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>He put his hand over the receiver. &quot;Starling, this is baloney, but did you hand <br/>Lecter anything at
          all in Memphis?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;No object.&quot; <br/>&quot;Nothing.&quot; <br/>&quot;You took him the drawings
          and stuff from his cell.&quot; <br/>&quot;I never gave it to him. The stuff's still in my bag. He gave
          <i>me </i>the file. That's all <br/></p>
        <p>that passed between us.&quot; <br/>Crawford tucked the phone under his jowl. &quot;Copley, that's unmitigated
          bullshit. I <br/></p>
        <p>want you to step on that bastard and do it now. Straight to the chief, straight to the TBI. <br/>See the
          hotline's posted with the rest. Burroughs is on it. Yes.&quot; He turned off the phone <br/>and stuffed it in
          his pocket. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Want some coffee, Starling? Coke?&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;What was that about handing things to Dr. Lecter?&quot; <br/>&quot;Chilton's saying you must have
        given Lecter something he used to slip the <br/></p>
        <p>ratchet on the cuffs. You didn't do it on purpose, he says--- it was just ignorance.&quot; <br/>Sometimes
          Crawford had angry little turtle-eyes. He watched how she took it. &quot;Did <br/>Chilton try to snap your
          garters, Starling? Is that what's the matter with him?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Maybe. I'll take black with sugar, please.&quot; <br/>While he was in the kitchen, she took deep
          breaths and looked around the room. If <br/></p>
        <p>you live in a dormitory or a barracks, it's comforting to be in a home. Even with the <br/>ground shaking
          under Starling, her sense of the Crawfords' lives in this house helped her. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford was coming, careful down the steps in his bifocals, carrying the cups. <br/>He was half an inch
          shorter in his moccasins. When Starling stood to take her coffee, <br/>their eyes were almost level. He
          smelled like soap, and his hair looked fluffy and gray. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Copley said they haven't found the ambulance yet. Police barracks are turning <br/>out all over the
          South.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>She shook her head. &quot;I don't know any details. The radio just had the bulletin--- <br/>Dr. Lecter killed
          two policemen and got away.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Two corrections officers.&quot; Crawford punched up the crawling text on his <br/>computer screen.
          &quot;Names were Boyle and Pembry. You deal with them?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>She nodded. &quot;They... put me out of the lockup. They were okay about it.&quot; <i>Pembry <br/>coming
          around Chilton, uncomfortable, determined, but country-courteous. Come on <br/>with me, now, he said. He had
          liver spots on his hands and forehead. Dead now, pale <br/>beneath his spots. <br/></i></p>
        <p>Suddenly Starling had to put her coffee down. She filled her lungs deep and <br/>looked at the ceiling for a
          moment. &quot;How'd he do it?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He got away in an ambulance, Copley said. We'll go into it. How did you make <br/>out with the blotter
          acid?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had spent the late afternoon and early evening walking the sheet of Plutos <br/>through Scientific
          Analysis on Krendler's orders. &quot;Nothing. They're trying the DEA files <br/>for a batch-match, but the
          stuff's ten years old. Documents may do better with the <br/>printing than DEA can do with the dope.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;But it <i>was </i>blotter acid.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes. Howd he do it, Mr. Crawford?&quot; <br/>&quot;Want
          to know?&quot; <br/>She nodded. <br/>&quot;Then I'll tell you. They loaded Lecter into an ambulance by
          mistake. They <br/></p>
        <p>thought he was Pembry, badly injured.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did he have on Pembry's uniform? They were about the

          keep it from dripping and stuffed it on top of the elevator. He put on the <br/>uniform, got himself, fixed
          up, laid on the floor and fired shots into the ceiling to start the <br/>stampede. I don't know what he did
          with the gun, stuffed it down the back of his pants, <br/>maybe. The ambulance comes, cops everywhere with
          their guns out. The ambulance crew <br/>came in fast and did what they're trained to do under fire--- they
          stuffed in an airway, <br/>slapped a bandage over the worst of it, pressure to stop bleeding, and hauled out
          of there. <br/>They did their job. The ambulance never made it to the hospital. The police are still </p>

          The Chief Gunny, John Brigham, saw it in the faculty meeting at <br/>Quantico a little while ago. He gave 'em

          Do you know what happens when you're recycled?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sure, you're sent back to the regional office that recruited you. You get to file <br/>reports and make
          coffee until you get another spot in a class.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I can promise you a place in a later class, but I can't keep them from recycling <br/>you if you miss

          Starling, Dr. Pilcher said he'd meet you in the Insect Zoo. I'll take you <br/></p>
        <p>over there,&quot; the guard said. <br/>To reach the Insect Zoo from the Constitution Avenue side of the
          museum, you <br/></p>
        <p>must take the elevator one level above the great stuffed elephant and cross a vast floor <br/>devoted to the
          study of man. <br/></p>
        <p>Tiers of skulls were first, rising and spreading, representing the explosion of <br/>human population since
          the time of Christ. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling and the guard moved in a dim landscape peopled with figures illustrating <br/>human origin and
          variation. Here were displays of ritual--- tattoos, bound feet, tooth <br/>modification, Peruvian surgery,

        <p>The Insect Zoo is a large room, dim now and loud with chirps and whirs. Cages <br/>and cases of live insects
          fill it. Children particularly like the zoo and troop through it all <br/>day. At night, left to themselves,
          the insects are busy. A few of the cases were lit with <br/>red, and the fire exit signs burned fiercely red
          in the dim room. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dr. Pilcher?&quot; the guard called from the door. <br/>&quot;Here,&quot; Pilcher said, holding a
          penlight up as a beacon. <br/>&quot;Will you bring this lady out?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes, thank you, Officer.&quot;
          <br/>Starling took her own small flashlight out of her purse and found the switch <br/></p>
        <p>already on, the batteries dead. The flash of anger she felt reminded her that she was tired <br/>and she had
          to bear down. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Hello, Officer Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;Dr. Pilcher.&quot; <br/>&quot;How about 'Professor Pilcher'?&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Are you a professor?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, but I'm not a doctor either. What I <i>am </i>is glad to
          see you. Want to look at <br/></p>
        <p>some bugs?&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure. Where's Dr. Roden?&quot; <br/>&quot;He made most of the progress over the
          last two nights with chaetaxy and finally <br/></p>
        <p>he had to crash. Did you see the bug before we started on it?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;It was
          just mush, really.&quot; <br/>&quot;But you got it, you figured it out.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yep. Just now.&quot;
          He stopped at a mesh cage. &quot;First let me show you a moth like <br/></p>
        <p>the one you brought in Monday. This is not exactly the same as yours, but the same <br/>family, an owlet.&quot;
          The beam of his flashlight found the large sheeny blue moth sitting on <br/>a small branch, its wings folded,
          Pilcher blew air at it and instantly the fierce face of an <br/>owl appeared as the moth flared the undersides
          of its wings at them, the eye-spots on the <br/>wings glaring like the last sight a rat ever sees. &quot;This
          one's <i>Caligo beltrao---</i> fairly <br/>common. But with this Klaus specimen, you're talking some heavy
          moths. Come on.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>At the end of the room was a case set back in a niche with a rail in front of it. The <br/>case was beyond
          the reach of children and it was covered with a cloth. A small <br/>humidifier hummed beside it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;We keep it behind glass to protect people's fingers--- it can fight. It likes the <br/>damp too, and
          glass keeps the humidity in.&quot; Pilcher lifted the cage carefully by its <br/>handles and moved it to the
          front of the niche. He lifted off the cover and turned on a <br/>small light above the cage. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;This is the Death's-head Moth,&quot; he said. &quot;That's nightshade she's sitting on--- <br/>we're
          hoping she'll lay.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The moth was wonderful and terrible to see, its large brown-black wings tented </p>

        long as men have come upon it suddenly in their happy gardens. The domed skull, <br/>a skull that is both skull
        and face, watching from its dark eyes, the cheekbones, the <br/>zygomatic arch traced exquisitely beside the
        eyes. <br/></p>
        <p><i>&quot;Acherontia styx,&quot;</i> Pitcher said. &quot;It's named for two rivers in Hell. Your man, he <br/>drops
          the bodies in a river every time--- did I read that?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Starling said. &quot;Is it rare?&quot; <br/>&quot;In this part of the world it is. There
          aren't any at all in nature.&quot; - . <br/>&quot;Where's it from?&quot; Starling leaned her face close to the
          mesh roof of the case. Her <br/></p>
        <p>breath stirred the fur on the moth's back. She jerked back when it squeaked and fiercely <br/>flapped its
          wings. She could feel the tiny breeze it made. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Malaysia. There's a European type too, called <i>atropos, </i>but this one and the one in <br/>Klaus'
          mouth are Malaysian.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So somebody raised it.&quot; <br/>Pilcher nodded. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said when she didn't look at him.
          &quot;It had to be shipped <br/></p>
        <p>from Malaysia as an egg or more likely as a pupa. Nobody's ever been able to get them to <br/>lay eggs in
          captivity. They mate, but no eggs. The hard part is finding the caterpillar in <br/>the jungle. After that,
          they're not hard to raise.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You said they can fight.&quot; <br/>&quot;The proboscis is sharp and stout, and they'll jam it in your
          finger if you fool with <br/></p>
        <p>them. It's an unusual weapon and alcohol doesn't affect it in preserved specimens. That <br/>helped us narrow
          the field so we could identify it so fast.&quot; Pilcher seemed suddenly <br/>embarrassed, as though he had
          boasted. &quot;They're tough too,&quot; he hurried on to say. &quot;They <br/>go in beehives and Bogart honey.
          One time we were collecting in Sabah, Borneo, and <br/>they'd come to the light behind the youth hostel. It
          was weird to hear them, we'd be---&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Where did this one come from?&quot; <br/>&quot;A swap with the Malaysian government. I don't know what

        <p>funny, there we were in the dark, waiting with this cyanide bucket, when---&quot; <br/>&quot;What kind of
          customs declaration came with this one? Do you have records of <br/></p>
        <p>that? Do they have to be cleared out of Malaysia? Who would have that?&quot; <br/>&quot;You're in a hurry.
          Look, I've written down all the stuff we have and the places to <br/></p>
        <p>put ads if you want to do that kind of thing. Come on, I'll take you out.&quot; <br/>They crossed the vast
          floor in silence. In the light of the elevator, Starling could <br/></p>
        <p>see that Pilcher was as tired as she was. <br/>&quot;You stayed up with this,&quot; she said. &quot;That was
          a good thing to do. I didn't mean to <br/></p>
        <p>be abrupt before, I just---&quot; <br/>&quot;I hope they get him. I hope you're through with this soon,&quot;
          he said. &quot;I put down a <br/></p>

          to get to know you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Maybe I should call you when I can.&quot; <br/>&quot;You definitely should, absolutely, I'd like that,
          &quot; Pilcher said. <br/>The elevator closed and Pitcher and Starling were gone. The floor devoted to man
          <br/></p>
        <p>was still and no human figure moved, not the tattooed, not the mummified, the bound feet <br/>didn't stir.

        front legs, she uncoiled her sharp proboscis and plunged it <br/>through the wax cap of a honey cell. Now she
        sat sucking quietly while all around her in <br/>the dark the chirps and whirs resumed, and with them the tiny

        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 41 <br/> <br/>C</b>atherine Baker Martin down in the hateful dark. Dark swarmed behind
          her <br/></p>
        <p>eyelids and, in jerky seconds of sleep, she dreamed the dark came into her. Dark came <br/>insidious, up her
          nose and into her ears, damp fingers of dark proposed themselves to <br/>each of her body openings. She put
          her hand over her mouth and nose, put her other hand <br/>over her vagina, clenched her buttocks, turned one
          ear to the mattress and sacrificed the <br/>other ear to the intrusion of the dark. With the dark came a
          sound, and she jerked awake. <br/>A familiar busy sound, a sewing machine. Variable speed. Slow, now fast.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Up in the basement the lights were on--- she could see a feeble disc of yellow <br/>high above her where the
          small hatch in the well lid stood open. The poodle barked a <br/>couple of times and the unearthly voice was
          talking to it, muffled. <br/></p>
        <p>Sewing. Sewing was so wrong down here. Sewing belongs to the light. The sunny <br/>sewing room of Catherine's
          childhood flashed so welcome in her mind... the housekeeper, <br/>dear Bea Love, at the machine... her little
          cat batted at the blowing curtain. <br/></p>
        <p>The voice blew it all away, fussing at the poodle. <br/>&quot;Precious, put that <i>down. </i>You'll stick
          yourself with a pin and <i>then </i>where will we <br/></p>
        <p>be? I'm almost done. Yes, Darlingheart. You get a Chew-wy<i> when we get through-y, </i>you <br/>get a
          Chew-wy <i>doody doody doo. &quot; <br/></i></p>
        <p>Catherine did not know how long she had been captive. She knew that she had <br/>washed twice--- the last
          time she had stood up in the light, wanting him to see her body, <br/>not sure if he was looking down from
          behind the blinding light. Catherine Baker Martin <br/>naked was a show-stopper, a girl and a half in all
          directions, and she knew it. She wanted <br/>him to see. She wanted out of the pit. Close enough to fuck is
          close enough to fight--- she <br/>said it silently to herself over and over as she washed. She was getting
          very little to eat <br/>and she knew she'd better do it while she had her strength. She knew she would fight
          him. <br/>She knew she could fight. Would it be better to fuck him first, fuck him as many times as <br/>he
          could do it and wear him out? She knew if she could ever get her legs around his neck <br/>she could send him
          home to Jesus in about a second and a half. <i>Can I stand to do that? <br/>You're damned right I can. Balls
            and eyes, balls and eyes, ballsandeyes. </i>But there had <br/>been no sound from above as she finished
          washing and put an the fresh jumpsuit. There <br/>was no reply to her offers as the bath bucket swayed up on
          its flimsy string and was <br/>replaced by her toilet bucket. <br/></p>
        <p>She waited now, hours later, listening to the sewing machine. She did not call out <br/>to him. In time,
          maybe a thousand breaths, she heard him going up the stairs, talking to <br/>the dog, saying something, &quot;---breakfast
          when I get back.&quot; He left the basement light on. <br/>Sometimes he did that. <br/></p>
        <p>Toenails and footsteps on the kitchen floor above. The dog whining. She believed <br/>her captor was leaving.
          Sometimes he went away for a long time. </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">

        again, short sharp barks, this time not as clear <br/>as the sounds had been when the dog was above her in the
        kitchen. Because the little dog <br/>was not in the kitchen. It had nosed the door open and it was down in the
        basement <br/>chasing mice, as it had done before when he was out. <br/></p>
        <p>Down in the dark, Catherine Martin felt beneath her mattress. She found the piece <br/>of chicken bone and
          sniffed it. It was hard not to eat the little shreds of meat and gristle <br/>on it. She put it in her mouth
          to get it warm. She stood up now, swaying a little in the <br/>dizzy dark. With her in the sheer pit was
          nothing but her futon, the jumpsuit she was <br/>wearing, the plastic toilet bucket and its flimsy cotton
          string stretching upward toward the <br/>pale yellow light. <br/></p>
        <p>She had thought about it in every interval when she could think. Catherine <br/>stretched as high as she
          could and grasped the string. Better to jerk or to pull? She had <br/>thought about it through thousands of
          breaths. Better to pull steadily. <br/></p>
        <p>The cotton string stretched more than she expected. She got a new grip as high as <br/>she could and pulled,
          swinging her arm from side to side, hoping the string was fraying <br/>where it passed over the wooden lip of
          the opening above her. She frayed until her <br/>shoulder ached. She pulled, the string stretching, now not
          stretching, no more stretch. <br/>Please break high. Pop, and it fell, hanks of it across her face. <br/></p>
        <p>Squatting on the floor, the string lying on her head and shoulder, net enough light <br/>from the hole far
          above to see the string piled on her. She didn't know how much she had. <br/>Must not tangle. Carefully she
          laid the string out on the floor in bights, measuring them <br/>on her forearm. She counted fourteen forearms.
          The string had broken at the lip of the <br/>well. <br/></p>
        <p>She tied the chicken bone with its shredded morsels of flesh securely into the line <br/>where it attached to
          the bucket handle. <br/></p>
        <p>Now the harder part. <br/>Work carefully. She was in her heavy-weather mind-set. It was like taking care of
          <br/></p>
        <p>yourself in a small boat in heavy weather. <br/>She tied the broken end of the string to her wrist,
          tightening the knot wjth her <br/></p>
        <p>teeth. <br/>She stood as clear of the string as possible. Holding the bucket by the handle, she <br/></p>
        <p>swung it in a big circle and threw it straight upward at the faint disc of light above her. <br/>The plastic
          bucket missed the open hatch, hit the underside of the lid and fell back, hitting <br/>her in the face and
          shoulder. The little dog barked louder. <br/></p>
        <p>She took the time to lay out the line and threw again, and again. On.the third <br/>throw, the bucket hit her
          broken finger when it fell and she had to lean against the in-<br/>sloping wall and breathe until the nausea
          went away. Throw four banged down on her, <br/>but five did not. It was out. The bucket was somewhere on the
          wooden cover of the well <br/>beside the open trap. How far from the hole? Get steady. Gently she pulled. She
          twitched <br/>the string to hear the bucket handle rattle against the wood above her. <br/></p>
        <p>The little-dog barked louder. <br/>She mustn't pull the bucket over the edge of the hole, but she must pull
          it dose. <br/></p>
        <p>She pulled it dose. <br/>The little dog among the mirrors and the mannequins in a nearby basement room. </p>

        <p>Now a voice, echoing faintly through the basement. <br/>&quot;Preeeee-cious.&quot; <br/>The little dog barked
          and jumped in place. Its fat little body quivered with the <br/></p>
        <p>barks. <br/>Now a wet kissing sound. <br/>The dog looked up at the kitchen floor above, but that wasn't where
          the sound <br/></p>
        <p>came from. <br/>A smack-smack sound like eating. &quot;Come on, Precious. Come on, Sweetheart.&quot; <br/>On
          its tiptoes, ears up, the dog went into the gloom. <br/>Slurp-slurp. &quot;Come on, Sweetums, come on,

        </p>
        <p>the side of the well and whined. <br/>Smack-smack-smack. <br/>The small poodle jumped up onto the wooden
          cover of the well. The smell was <br/></p>
        <p>over here, between the bucket and the hole. The little dog barked at the bucket, whined in <br/>indecision.
          The chicken bone twitched ever so slightly. <br/></p>
        <p>The poodle crouched with its nose between its front paws, behind in the air, <br/>wagging furiously. It
          barked twice and pounced on the chicken bone, gripping it with its <br/>teeth. The bucket seemed to be trying
          to nose the little dog away from the chicken. The <br/>poodle growled at the bucket and held on, straddling
          the handle, teeth firmly clamped on <br/>the bone. Suddenly the bucket bumped the poodle over, off its feet,
          pushed it, it struggled <br/>to get up, bumped again, it struggled with the bucket, a back foot and haunch
          went off in <br/>the hole, its claws scrabbled frantically at the wood, the bucket sliding, wedging in the
          <br/>hole with the dog's hindquarters and the little dog pulled free, the bucket slipping over the <br/>edge
          and plunging, the bucket escaping down the hole with the chicken bone. The poodle <br/>barked angrily down the
          hole, barks ringing down in the well. Then it stopped barking <br/>and cocked its head at a sound only it
          could hear. It scrambled off the top of the well and <br/>went up the stairs yipping as a door slammed
          somewhere upstairs. <br/></p>
        <p>Catherine Baker Martin's tears spread hot on her cheeks and fell, plucking at the <br/>front of her jumpsuit,

        <p>St. Louis. He wore a brown hat and a raincoat buttoned to the neck. A neat surgical <br/>bandage covered his
          nose and cheeks. <br/></p>
        <p>He signed the register &quot;Lloyd Wyman,&quot; a signature he had practiced in Wyman's <br/>car. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How will you be paying, Mr. Wyman?&quot; the clerk said. <br/>&quot;American Express.&quot; Dr. Lecter
          handed the man Lloyd Wyman's credit card. <br/>Soft piano music came from the lounge. At the bar Dr. Lecter
          could see two <br/></p>
        <p>people with bandages across their noses. A middle-aged couple crossed to the elevators, <br/>humming a Cole
          Porter tune. The woman wore a gauze patch over her eye. <br/></p>
        <p>The clerk finished making the credit card impression. &quot;You do know, Mr. <br/>Wyman, you're entitled to
          use the hospital garage.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; Dr. Lecter said. He had already parked Wyman's car in the <br/>garage, with Wyman
          in the trunk. <br/></p>
        <p>The bellman who carried Wyman's bags to the small suite got one of Wyman's <br/>five-dollar 'bills in
          compensation. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter ordered a drink and a sandwich and relaxed with a long shower. <br/>The suite seemed enormous to
          Dr. Lecter after his long confinement. He enjoyed <br/></p>

      <div><p>Dr. Lecter's visage was too well known for him to be able to take advantage of the <br/>plastic surgeons
        here, but it was one place in the world where he could walk around with <br/>a bandage on his face without

        <p>He had stayed here once before, years ago, when he was doing psychiatric <br/>research in the superb Robert

        <p>Heady to have a window, several windows. He stood at his windows in the dark, <br/>watching the car lights

          drive from Memphis. <br/></p>
        <p>The only real rush of the evening had been in the underground garage at Memphis <br/>International Airport.
          Cleaning up with cotton pads and alcohol and distilled water in the <br/>back of the parked ambulance was not
          at all convenient. Once he was in the attendant's <br/>whites, it was just a matter of catching a single
          traveler in a deserted aisle of long-term <br/>parking in the great garage. The man obligingly leaned into the
          trunk of his car for his <br/>sample case, and never saw Dr. Lecter come up behind him. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter wondered if the police believed he was fool enough to fly from the <br/>airport. <br/></p>
        <p>The only problem on the drive to St. Louis was finding the lights, the dimmers, <br/>and the wipers in the
          foreign car, as Dr. Lecter was unfamiliar with stalk controls beside <br/>the steering wheel. <br/></p>
        <p>Tomorrow he would shop for things he needed, hair bleach, barbering supplies, a <br/>sunlamp, and there were
          other, prescription, items that he would obtain to make some <br/>immediate changes in his appearance. When it
          was convenient, he would move on. <br/></p>

          <br/></p>
        <p>let go of her hand. <br/>He put his ear to her chest. He heard a soft beat, a flutter, and then her heart
          <br/></p>
        <p>stopped. There was nothing to hear, there was only a curious cool rushing. He didn't <br/>know if the sound
          was in her chest or only in his ears. <br/></p>

          died. His chin pushed back the scarf from the remnants of her hair. <br/>He did not cry. He had done all that.

        <p>Crawford changed her into her favorite, her best bed gown and sat for a while <br/>beside the high bed,
          holding her hand against his cheek. It was a square, clever hand, <br/>marked with a lifetime of gardening,
          marked by IV needles now. <br/></p>
        <p>When she came in from the garden, her hands smelled like thyme. <br/>(&quot;Think about it like egg white on

          headboard of his bed and very comfortable, <br/></p>
        <p>the little dog curled up warm on his tummy. <br/>Mr. Gumb had just washed his hair and he had a towel wrapped
          around his head. <br/></p>
        <p>He rummaged in the sheets, found the remote control for his VCR, and pushed the play <br/>button. <br/></p>
        <p>He had composed his program from two pieces of videotape copied onto one </p>

      <div><p>cassette. He watched it every day when he was making vital preparations, and he always <br/>watched it
        just before he harvested a hide. <br/></p>
        <p>The first tape was from scratchy film of Movietone News, a black-and-white <br/>newsreel from 1948. It was
          the quarter-finals of the Miss Sacramento contest, a <br/>preliminary event on the long road to the Miss
          America pageant in Atlantic City. <br/></p>
        <p>This was the swimsuit competition, and all the girls carried flowers as they came <br/>in a file to the
          stairs and mounted to the stage. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb's poodle had been through this many times and she squinted her eyes <br/>when she heard the music,
          knowing she'd be squeezed. <br/></p>
        <p>The beauty contestants looked very World War II. They wore Rose Marie Reid <br/>swimsuits, and some of the
          faces were lovely. Their legs were nicely shaped too, some of <br/>them, but they lacked muscle tone and
          seemed to lap a little at the knee. <br/></p>
        <p>Gumb squeezed the poodle. <br/>&quot;Precious, here she comes, hereshecomes hereshecomes!&quot; <br/>And here
          she came, approaching the stairs in her white swimsuit, with a radiant <br/></p>
        <p>smile for the young man who assisted at the stairs, then quick on her high heels away, the <br/>camera
          following the backs of her thighs: Mom. There was Mom. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb didn't have to touch his remote control, he'd done it all when he <br/>dubbed this copy. In reverse,
          here she came backward, backward down the stairs, took <br/>back her smile from the young man, backed up the
          aisle, now forward again, and back <br/>and forward, forward and back. <br/></p>
        <p>When she smiled at the young man, Gumb smiled too. <br/>There was one more shot of her in a group, but it
          always blurred in freeze-frame. <br/></p>
        <p>Better just to run it at speed and get the glimpse. Mom was with the other girls, <br/>congratulating the
          winners. <br/></p>
        <p>The next item he'd taped off cable television in a motel in Chicago--- he'd had to <br/>rush out and buy a
          VCR and stay an extra night to get it. This was the loop film they run <br/>on seedy cable channels late at
          night as background for the sex ads that crawl up the <br/>screen in print. The loops are made of junk film,
          fairly innocuous naughty movies from <br/>the forties and fifties, and there was nudist camp volleyball and
          the less explicit parts of <br/>thirties sex movies where the male actors wore false noses and still had their
          socks on. <br/>The sound was any music at all. Right now it was &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; totally out of
          sync <br/>with the sprightly action. <br/></p>
        <p>There was nothing Mr. Gumb could do about the ads crawling up the screen. He <br/>just had to put up with
          them. <br/></p>
        <p>Here it is, an outdoor pool--- in California, judging from the foliage. Good pool <br/>furniture, everything
          very fifties. Naked swimming, some graceful girls. A few of them <br/>might have appeared in a couple of
          B-pictures. Sprightly and bouncing, they climbed out <br/>of the pool and ran, much faster than the music, to
          the ladder of a water slide, climbed <br/>up--- down they came, Wheeee! Breasts lifting as they plunged down
          the slide, laughing, <br/>legs out straight, Splash! <br/></p>
        <p>Here came Mom. Here'she came, climbing out of the pool behind the girl with the <br/>curly hair. Her face was
          partly covered by a crawl ad from Sinderella, a sex boutique, but <br/>here you saw her going away, and there
          she went up the ladder all shiny and wet, <br/>wonderfully buxom and supple, with a small cesarean scar and
          down the slide Wheeee! <br/>So beautiful, and even if he couldn't see her face, Mr. Gumb knew in his heart it
          was </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Mom, filmed after the last time in his life that he ever got to really see her. Except in his <br/>mind,
        of course. <br/></p>
        <p>The scene switched to a filmed ad for a marital aid and abruptly ended. <br/>The poodle squinted her eyes two
          seconds before Mr. Gumb hugged her tight. <br/>&quot;Oh, Precious. Come here to Mommy. Mommy's gonna be
          <i>so </i>beautiful.&quot; <br/>Much to do, much to do, much to do to get ready for tomorrow. <br/>He could
          never hear it from the kitchen even at the top of its voice, thank <br/></p>
        <p>goodness, but he could hear it on the stairs as he went down to the basement. He had <br/>hoped it would be
          quiet and asleep. The poodle, riding beneath his arm, growled back at <br/>the sounds from the pit. <br/></p>
        <p><i>&quot;You've</i> been raised better than that,&quot; he said into the fur on the back of her head. <br/>The
          oubliette room is through a door to the left at the bottom of the stairs. He <br/></p>
        <p>didn't spare it a glance, nor did he listen to the words from the pit--- as far as he was <br/>concerned,
          they bore not the slightest resemblance to English. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb turned right into the workroom, put the poodle down and turned on the <br/>lights. A few moths
          fluttered and lit harmlessly on the wire mesh covering the ceiling <br/>lights. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb was meticulous in the workroom. He always mixed his fresh solutions <br/>in stainless steel, never
          in aluminum. <br/></p>
        <p>He had learned to do everything well ahead of time. As he worked he admonished <br/>himself: <br/></p>
        <p>You have to be orderly, you have to be precise, you have to be expeditious, <br/>because the problems are
          formidable. <br/></p>
        <p>The human skin is heavy--- sixteen to eighteen percent of body weight--- and <br/>slippery. An entire hide is
          hard to handle and easy to drop when it's still wet. Time is <br/>important too; skin begins to shrink
          immediately after it has been harvested, most notably <br/>from young adults, whose skin is tightest to begin
          with. <br/></p>
        <p>Add to that the fact that the skin is not perfectly elastic, even in the young. If you <br/>stretch it, it
          never regains its original proportions. Stitch something perfectly smooth, <br/>then pull it too hard over a
          tailor's ham, and it bulges and puckers. Sitting at the machine <br/>and crying your eyes out won't remove one
          pucker. Then there are the cleavage lines, and <br/>you'd better know where they are, Skin doesn't stretch the
          same amount in all directions <br/>before the collagen bundles deform and the fibers tear; pull the wrong way,
          and you get a <br/>stretch mark. <br/></p>
        <p>Green material is simply impossible to work with. Much experimentation went <br/>into this, along with much
          heartbreak, before Mr. Gumb got it right. <br/></p>
        <p>In the end he found the old ways were best. His procedures were these: First he <br/>soaked his items in the
          aquariums, in vegetable extracts developed by the Native <br/>Americans--- all-natural substances that contain
          no mineral salts whatsoever. Then he <br/>used the method that produced the matchless butter-soft buckskin of
          the New World--- <br/>classic brain tanning. The Native Americans believed that each animal has just enough
          <br/>brains to tan its own hide. Mr. Gumb knew that this was not true and long ago had quit <br/>trying it,
          even with the largest-brained primate. He had a freezer full of beef brains now, <br/>so he never ran short.
          <br/></p>
        <p>The problems of processing the material he could manage; practice had made him <br/>near perfect. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Difficult structural problems remained, but he was especially well qualified to <br/>solve them, too.
        <br/></p>
        <p>The workroom opened into a basement corridor leading to a disused bath where <br/>Mr. Gumb stored his
          hoisting tackle and his timepiece, and on to the studio and the vast <br/>black warren beyond. <br/></p>
        <p>He opened his studio door to brilliant light--- floodlights and incandescent tubes, <br/>color-corrected to
          daylight, were fastened to ceiling beams. Mannequins posed on a <br/>raised floor of pickled oak. All were
          partly clad, some in leather and some in muslin <br/>patterns for leather garments. Eight mannequins were
          doubled in the two mirrored walls--<br/>- good plate mirror too, not tiles. A makeup table held cosmetics,
          several wig forms, and <br/>wigs. This was the brightest of studios, all white and blond oak. <br/></p>
        <p>The mannequins wore commercial work in progress, dramatic Armani knockoffs <br/>mostly, in fine black
          cabretta leather, all roll-pleats and pointed shoulders and <br/>breastplates. <br/></p>
        <p>The third wall was taken up by a large worktable, two commercial sewing <br/>machines, two dressmaker's
          forms, and a tailor's form cast from the very torso of Jame <br/>Gumb. <br/></p>
        <p>Against the fourth wall, dominating this bright room, was a great black armoire in <br/>Chinese lacquer that
          rose almost to the eight-foot ceiling. It was old and the designs on it <br/>had faded; a few gold scales
          remained where a dragon was, his white eye still clear and <br/>staring, and here was the red tongue of
          another dragon whose body has faded away. The <br/>lacquer beneath them remained intact, though it was
          crackled. <br/></p>
        <p>The armoire, immense and deep, had nothing to do with commercial work. It <br/>contained on forms and hangers
          the Special Things, and its doors were closed. <br/></p>
        <p>The little dog lapped from her water bowl in the corner and lay down between the <br/>feet of a mannequin,
          her eyes on Mr. Gumb. <br/></p>
        <p>He had been working on a leather jacket. He needed to finish it--- he'd meant to <br/>get everything out of
          the way, but he was in a creative fever now and his own muslin <br/>fitting garment didn't satisfy him yet.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb had progressed in tailoring far beyond what the California Department <br/>of Corrections had taught
          him in his youth, but this was a true challenge. Even working <br/>delicate cabretta leather does not prepare
          you for really fine work. <br/></p>
        <p>Here he had two muslin fitting garments, like white waistcoats, one his exact size <br/>and one he had made
          from measurements he took while Catherine Baker Martin was still <br/>unconscious. When he put the smaller one
          on his tailor's form, the problems were <br/>apparent. She was a big girl, and wonderfully proportioned, but
          she wasn't as big as Mr. <br/>Gumb, and not nearly so broad across the back. <br/></p>
        <p>His ideal was a seamless garment. This was not possible. He was determined, <br/>though, that the bodice
          front be absolutely seamless and without blemish. This meant all <br/>figure corrections had to be made on the
          back. Very difficult. He'd already discarded one <br/>fitting muslin and started over. With judicious
          stretching, he could get by with two <br/>underarm darts--- not French darts, but vertical inset darts, apexes
          down. Two waist darts <br/>also in the back, just inside his kidneys. He was used to working with only a tiny
          seam <br/>allowance. <br/></p>
        <p>His considerations went beyond the visual aspects to the tactile; it was not <br/>inconceivable that an
          attractive person might be hugged. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Mr. Gumb sprinkled talc lightly on his hands and embraced the tailor's form of his <br/>body in a natural,
        comfortable hug. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Give me a kiss,&quot; he said playfully to the empty air where the head should be. <br/>&quot;Not <i>you</i>,
          silly,&quot; he told the little dog, when she raised her ears. <br/></p>
        <p>Gumb caressed the back of the form at the natural reach of his arms. Then he <br/>walked behind it to
          consider the powder marks. Nobody wanted to feel a seam. In an <br/>embrace, though, the hands lap over the
          center of the back. Also, he reasoned, we are <br/>accustomed to the centerline of a spine. It is not as
          jarring as an asymmetry in our bodies. <br/>Shoulder seams were definitely out, then. A center dart at the top
          was the answer, apex a <br/>little above the center of the shoulder blades. He could use the same seam to
          anchor the <br/>stout yoke built into the lining to provide support. Lycra panels beneath plackets on both
          <br/>sides--- he must remember to get the Lycra--- and a Velcro closure beneath the placket on <br/>the right.
          He thought about those marvelous Charles James gowns where the seams were <br/>staggered to lie perfectly
          flat. <br/></p>
        <p>The dart in back would be covered by his hair, or rather the hair he would have <br/>soon. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb slipped the muslin off the dressmaker's form and started to work. <br/>The sewing machine was old
          and finely made, an ornate foot-treadle machine that <br/></p>
        <p>had been converted to electricity perhaps forty years ago. On the arm of the machine was <br/>painted in
          gold-leaf scroll &quot;I Never Tire, I Serve.&quot; The foot treadle remained operative, <br/>and Gumb started
          the machine with it for each series of stitches. For fine stitching, he <br/>preferred to work barefoot,
          rocking the treadle delicately with his meaty foot, gripping <br/>the front edge of it with his painted toes
          to prevent overruns. For a while there were only <br/>the sounds of the machine, and the little dog snoring,
          and the hiss of the steam pipes in <br/>the warm basement. <br/></p>
        <p>When he had finished inserting the darts in the muslin pattern garment, he tried it <br/>on in front of the
          mirrors. The little dog watched from the corner, her head cocked. <br/></p>
        <p>He needed to ease it a little under the arm holes. There were a few remaining <br/>problems with facings and
          interfacings. Otherwise it was so nice. It was supple, pliant, <br/>bouncy. He could see himself just running
          up the ladder of a water slide as fast as you <br/>please. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb played with the lights and his wigs for some dramatic effects, and he <br/>tried a wonderful choker
          necklace of shells over the collar line. It would be stunning <br/>when he wore a d&#233;collet&#233; gown or
          hostess pajamas over his new thorax. <br/></p>
        <p>It was so tempting to just go on with it now, to really get busy, but his eyes were <br/>tired. He wanted his
          hands to be absolutely steady, too, and he just wasn't up for the <br/>noise. Patiently he picked out the
          stitches and laid out the pieces. A perfect pattern to cut <br/>by. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Tomorrow, Precious,&quot; he told the little dog as he set the beef brains out to thaw. <br/>&quot;We'll
          do it first thing tomooooooorooow. Mommy's gonna be so <i>beautiful </i>!<i>&quot;</i> <br/></p>

        <p>fear of the dream. She bit the corner of the sheet and pressed her palms over her ears, </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>waiting to find out if she was truly awake and away from it. Silence and no lambs <br/>screaming. When she
        knew she was awake her heart slowed, but her feet would not stay <br/>still beneath the covers. In a moment her
        mind would race, she knew it. <br/></p>
        <p>It was a relief when a flush of hot anger rather than fear shot through her. <br/>&quot;Nuts,&quot; she said,
          and put a foot out in the air. <br/>In all the long day, when she had been disrupted by Chilton, insulted by
          Senator <br/></p>
        <p>Martin, abandoned and rebuked by Krendler, taunted by Dr. Lecter and sickened by his <br/>bloody escape, and
          put off the job by Jack Crawford, there was one thing that stung the <br/>worst: being called a thief. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Senator Martin was a mother under extreme duress, and she was sick of <br/>policemen pawing her daughter's
          things. She hadn't meant it. <br/></p>
        <p>Still, the accusation stuck in Starling like a hot needle. <br/>As a small child, Starling had been taught
          that thieving is the cheapest, most <br/></p>
        <p>despicable act short of rape and murder for money. Some kinds of manslaughter were <br/>preferable to theft.
          <br/></p>
        <p>As a child in institutions where there were few prizes and many hungers, she had <br/>learned to hate a
          thief. <br/></p>
        <p>Lying in the dark, she faced another reason Senator Martin's implication bothered <br/>her so. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling knew what the malicious Dr. Lecter would say, and it was true: she was <br/>afraid there was
          something tacky that Senator Martin saw in her, something cheap, <br/>something thieflike that Senator Martin
          reacted to. That Vanderbilt bitch. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter would relish pointing out that class resentment, the buried anger that <br/>comes with mother's
          milk, was a factor too. Starling gave away nothing to any Martin in <br/>education, intelligence, drive, and
          certainly physical appearance, but still it was there and <br/>she knew it. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling was an isolated member of a fierce tribe with no formal genealogy but the <br/>honors list and the
          penal register. Dispossessed in Scotland, starved out of Ireland, a lot <br/>of them were inclined to the
          dangerous trades. Many generic Starlings had been used up <br/>this way, had thumped on the bottom of narrow
          holes or slid off planks with a shot at <br/>their feet, or were commended to glory with a cracked &quot;Taps&quot;
          in the cold when everyone <br/>wanted to go home. A few may have been recalled tearily by the officers on
          regimental <br/>mess nights, the way a man in drink remembers a good bird dog. Faded names in a Bible. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>None of them had been very smart, as far as Starling could tell, except for a great-<br/>aunt who wrote
          wonderfully in her diary until she got &quot;brain fever.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>They didn't steal, though. <br/>School was the thing in America, don't you know, and the Starlings caught on
          to <br/></p>
        <p>that. One of Starling's uncles had his junior college degree cut on his tombstone. <br/>Starling had lived by
          schools, her weapon the competitive exam, for all the years <br/></p>
        <p>when there was no place else for her to go. <br/>She knew she could pull out of this. She could be what she
          had always been, ever <br/></p>
        <p>since she'd learned how it works: she could be near the top of her class, approved, <br/>included, chosen,
          and not sent away. <br/></p>
        <p>It was a matter of working hard and being careful. Her grades would be good. The <br/>Korean couldn't kill
          her in PE. Her name would be engraved on the big plaque in the <br/>lobby, the &quot;Possible Board,&quot; for
          extraordinary performance on the range. </p>

      <div><p>In four weeks she would be a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <br/>Would she have to
        watch out for that fucking Krendler for the rest of her life? <br/>In the presence of the Senator, he had wanted
        to wash his hands of her. Every <br/></p>
        <p>time Starling thought about it, it stung. He wasn't positive that he would find evidence in <br/>the
          envelope. That was shocking. Picturing Krendler now in her mind, she saw him <br/>wearing Navy oxfords on his
          feet like the mayor, her father's boss, coming to collect the <br/>watchman's clock. <br/></p>
        <p>Worse, Jack Crawford in her mind seemed diminished. The man was under more <br/>strain than anyone should
          have to bear. He had sent her in. to check out Raspail's car with <br/>no support or evidence of authority.
          Okay, she had asked to go under those terms--- the <br/>trouble was a fluke. But Crawford had to know there'd
          be trouble when Senator Martin <br/>saw her in Memphis; there would have been trouble even if she hadn't found
          the fuck <br/>pictures. <br/></p>
        <p><i>Catherine Baker Martin lay in this same darkness that held her now. </i>Starling had <br/>forgotten it for
          a moment while she thought about her own best interests. <br/></p>
        <p>Pictures of the past few days punished Starling for the lapse, flashed on her in <br/>sudden color, too much
          color, shocking color, the color that leaps out of black when <br/>lightning strikes at night. <br/></p>
        <p>It was Kimberly that haunted her now. Fat dead Kimberly who had her ears <br/>pierced trying to look pretty
          and saved to have her legs waxed. Kimberly with her hair <br/>gone. Kimberly her sister. Starling did not
          think Catherine Baker Martin would have <br/>much time for Kimberly. Now they were sisters under the skin.
          Kimberly lying in a <br/>funeral home full of state trooper buckaroos. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling couldn't look at it anymore. She tried to turn her face away as a swimmer <br/>turns to breathe.
          <br/></p>
        <p>All of Buffalo Bill's victims were women, his obsession was women, he lived to <br/>hunt women. Not one woman
          was hunting him full time. Not one woman investigator had <br/>looked at every one of his crimes. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling wondered if Crawford would have the nerve to use her as a technician <br/>when he had to go look at
          Catherine Martin. Bill would &quot;do her tomorrow,&quot; Crawford <br/>predicted. <i>Do her. Do her. Do her.

        <p><i>&quot;Fuck</i> this,&quot; Starling said aloud and put her feet on the floor. <br/>&quot;You're over there
          corrupting a moron, aren't you, Starling?&quot; Ardelia Mapp said. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sneaked him in here while I was asleep and now you're giving him instructions--- don't <br/>think I
          don't hear you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sorry, Ardelia, I didn't---&quot; <br/>&quot;You've got to be a lot more specific with 'em than that,
          Starling. You can't just <br/></p>
        <p>say what <i>you </i>said. Corrupting morons is just like journalism, you've got to tell 'em<i> What, <br/>When,
          Where, and How.</i> I think <i>Why </i>gets self-explanatory as you go along.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Have you got any laundry?&quot; <br/>&quot;I thought you said did I have any laundry.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yep,
          I think I'll run a load. Whatcha got?&quot; <br/>&quot;Just those sweats on the back of the door.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay.
          Shut your eyes, I'm gonna turn on the light for just a second.&quot; <br/>It was not the Fourth Amendment
          notes for her upcoming exam that she piled on <br/></p>
        <p>top of the clothes basket and lugged down the hall to the laundry room. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>She took the Buffalo Bill file, a four-inch-thick pile of hell and pain in a buff <br/>cover printed with
        ink the color of blood. With it was a hotline printout of her report on <br/>the Death's-head Moth. <br/></p>
        <p>She'd have to give the file back tomorrow and, if she wanted this copy to be <br/>complete, sooner or later
          she had to insert her report. In the warm laundry room, in the <br/>washing machine's comforting chug, she
          took off the rubber bands that held the file <br/>together. She laid out the papers on the clothes-folding
          shelf and tried to do the insert <br/>without seeing any of the pictures, without thinking of what pictures
          might be added <br/>soon. The map was on top, that was fine. But there was handwriting on the map. <br/></p>
        <p>Dr. Lecter's elegant script ran across the Great Lakes, and it said: <br/> <br/>Clarice, does this
          <i>random </i>scattering of sites seem <br/>overdone to you? Doesn't it seem <i>desperately </i>ran- <br/>dom?
          Random past all possible convenience? <br/>Does it suggest to you the elaborations of a bad <br/>liar? <br/>
          <br/> Ta, <br/> Hannibal Lecter <br/> <br/>P.S. Don't bother to flip through, there isn't any- <br/>thing
          else. <br/> <br/>It took twenty minutes of page-turning to be sure there wasn't anything else. <br/>Starling
          called the hotline from the pay phone in the hall and read the message to <br/></p>
        <p>Burroughs. She wondered when Burroughs slept. <br/>&quot;I have to tell you, Starling, the market in Lecter
          information is way down,&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Burroughs said. &quot;Did Jack call you about Billy Rubin?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>She leaned against
          the wall with her eyes closed while, he described Dr. Lecter's <br/></p>
        <p>joke. <br/>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Jack says they'll go on with the sex-change
          clinics, <br/></p>
        <p>but how hard? If you look at the information in the computer, the way the field entries are <br/>styled, you
          can see that all the Lecter information, yours and the stuff from Memphis, has <br/>special prefixes. All the
          Baltimore stuff or all the Memphis stuff or both can be knocked <br/>out of consideration with one button. I
          think Justice wants to push the button on all of it. I <br/>got a memo here suggesting the bug in Klaus'
          throat was, let's see, 'flotsam.' &quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You'll punch this up for Mr. Crawford, though,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;Sure, I'll put it on his
          screen, but we're not calling him right now. You shouldn't <br/></p>
        <p>either. Bella died a little while ago.&quot; <br/>&quot;Oh,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;Listen, on the
          bright side, our guys in Baltimore took a look at Lecter's cell in the <br/></p>
        <p>asylum. That orderly, Barney, helped out. They got brass grindings off a bolt head in <br/>Lecter's cot where
          he made his handcuff key. Hang in there, kid. You're gonna come out <br/>smelling like a rose.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Burroughs. Good night.&quot; </p>

      <div><p><i>Smelling like a rose. Putting Vicks VapoRub under her nostrils. <br/></i>Daylight coming on the last
        day of Catherine Martin' s life. <br/>What could Dr. Lecter mean? <br/>There was no knowing what Dr. Lecter
        knew. When she first gave him the file, <br/></p>
        <p>she expected him to enjoy the pictures and use the file as a prop while he told her what he <br/>already knew
          about Buffalo Bill. <br/></p>
        <p>Maybe he was always lying to her, just as he lied to Senator Martin. Maybe he <br/>didn't know or understand
          anything about Buffalo Bill. <br/></p>
        <p><i>He sees very clearly--- he damn sure sees through me. </i>It's hard to accept that <br/>someone can
          understand you without wishing you well. At Starling's age it hadn't <br/>happened to her much. <br/></p>
        <p><i>Desperately random, </i>Dr. Lecter said. <br/>Starling and Crawford and everyone else had stared at the
          map with its dots <br/></p>
        <p>marking the abductions and body dumps. It had looked to Starling like a black <br/>constellation with a date
          beside each star, and she knew Behavioral Science had once <br/>tried imposing zodiac signs on the map without
          result. <br/></p>
        <p>If Dr. Lecter was reading for recreation, why would he fool with the map? She <br/>could see him flipping
          through the report, making fun of the prose style of some of the <br/>contributors. <br/></p>
        <p>There was no pattern in the abductions and body dumps, no relationships of <br/>convenience, no coordination
          in time with any known business conventions, any spate of <br/>burglaries or clothesline thefts or other
          fetish-oriented crimes. <br/></p>
        <p>Back in the laundry room, with the dryer spinning, Starling walked her fingers <br/>over the map. Here an
          abduction, there the dump. Here the second abduction, there the <br/>dump. Here the third and---. But are
          these dates backward or, no, the second body was <br/>discovered first. <br/></p>
        <p>That fact was recorded, unremarked, in smudged ink beside the location on the <br/>map. The body of the
          second woman abducted was found first, floating in the Wabash <br/>River in downtown Lafayette, Indiana, just
          below Interstate 65. <br/></p>
        <p>The first young woman reported missing was taken from Belvedere, Ohip, near <br/>Columbus, and found much
          later in the Blackwater River in Missouri, outside of Lone <br/>Jack. The body was weighted. No others were
          weighted. <br/></p>
        <p>The body of the first victim was sunk in water in a remote area. The second was <br/>dumped in a river
          upstream from a city, where quick discovery was certain. <br/></p>
        <p>Why? <br/>The one he started with was well hidden, the second one, not. <br/>Why? <br/>What does &quot;desperately
          random&quot; mean? <br/>The first, first. What did Dr. Lecter say about &quot;first&quot;? What did anything
          mean <br/></p>
        <p>that Dr. Lecter said? <br/>Starling looked at the notes she had scribbled on the airplane from Memphis. <br/>Dr.
          Lecter said there was enough in the file to locate the killer. &quot;Simplicity,&quot; he <br/></p>
        <p>said. What about &quot;first,&quot; where was first? Here--- &quot;First principles&quot; were important.
          &quot;First <br/>principles&quot; sounded like pretentious bullshit when he said it. <br/></p>
        <p><i>What does he do, Clarice? What is the first and principal thing he does, what <br/>need does he serve by
          killing? He covets. How do we begin to covet? We begin by </i></p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p><i>coveting what the see every day. <br/></i>It was easier to think about Dr. Lecter's statements when she
        wasn't feeling his <br/></p>
        <p>eyes on her skin. It was easier here in the safe heart of Quantico. <br/>If we begin to covet by coveting
          what we see every day, did Buffalo Bill surprise <br/></p>
        <p>himself when he killed the first one? Did he do someone close around him? Is that why <br/>he hid the first
          body well, and the second one poorly? Did he abduct the second one far <br/>from home and dump her where she'd
          be found quickly because he wanted to establish <br/>early the belief that the abduction sites were random?
          <br/></p>
        <p>When Starling thought of the victims, Kimberly Emberg came first to mind <br/>beause she had seen Kimberly
          dead and, in a sense, had taken Kimberly's part. <br/></p>
        <p>Here was the first one. Fredrica Bimmel, twenty-two, Belvedere, Ohio. There <br/>were two photos. In her
          yearbook picture she looked large and plain, with good thick hair <br/>and a good complexion. In the second
          photo, taken at the Kansas City morgue, she <br/>looked like nothing human. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling called Burroughs again. He was sounding a little hoarse by now, but he <br/>listened. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So what are you saying, Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Maybe he lives in Belvedere, Ohio, where the first
          victim lived. Maybe he saw <br/></p>
        <p>her every day, and he killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her <br/>a 7-Up and
          talk about the choir. So he did a good job of hiding the body and then he <br/>grabbed another one far from
          home. He didn't hide that one very well, so it would be <br/>found first and the attention would be directed
          away from him. You know how much <br/>attention a missing-person report gets, it gets zip until the body's
          found.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Starling, the return's better where the trail is fresh, people remember better, <br/>witnesses---&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's what I'm saying. He <i>knows </i>that.&quot; <br/>&quot;For instance, you won't be able to
          sneeze today without spraying a cop in that <br/></p>
        <p>last one's hometown--- Kimberly Emberg from Detroit. Lot of interest in Kimberly <br/>Emberg all of a sudden
          since little Martin disappeared. All of a sudden they're working <br/>the hell out of it. You never heard me
          say that.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Will you put it up for Mr. Crawford, about the first town?&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure. Hell, I'll put it on
          the hotline for everybody. I'm not saying it's bad <br/></p>
        <p>thinking, Starling, but the town was picked over pretty good as soon as the woman--- -<br/>what's her name,
          Bimmel, is it? as soon as Bimmel was identified. The Columbus office <br/>worked Belvedere, and so did a lot
          of locals. You've got it all there. You're not gonna <br/>raise much interest in Belvedere or any other theory
          of Dr. Lecter's this morning.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;All he---&quot; <br/>&quot;Starling, we're sending a gift to UNICEF for Bella. You want in, I'll put
          your <br/></p>
        <p>name on the card.&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure, thanks Mr. Burroughs.&quot; <br/>Starling got the clothes out of the
          dryer. The warm laundry felt good and smelled <br/></p>
        <p>good. She hugged the warm laundry close to her chest. <br/><i>Her mother with an armload of sheets. <br/></i>Today

          looking real in the light. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Send me,&quot; she said. <br/>Crawford had just picked out his wife's coffin and he carried in a paper

        <p>of her shoes he had mistakenly brought. He collected himself. <br/>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; Starling said.
          &quot;I wouldn't came now if there were any other time. <br/></p>
        <p>Send me.&quot; <br/>Crawford jammed his hands in his pockets, turned his neck in his collar until it <br/>

          raised her hand to him. She didn't touch his face or his hand, there didn't seem <br/></p>
        <p>to be any place to touch, and she turned and ran for the Pinto. <br/>Crawford patted his pockets as she drove
          away. He had given her the last cent he <br/></p>

          got out of the car. He lit a cigarette and smoked furiously. As his <br/>gift to Crawford he would dawdle
          until Crawford was dried off and pissed off and <br/>justified in chewing him out. <br/></p>
        <p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 49 <br/> <br/>O</b>n the morning of the fourth day, Mr. Gumb was ready to harvest the
          hide. <br/>He came in from shopping with the last things he needed, and it was hard to keep <br/></p>
        <p>from running down the basement stairs. In the studio he unpacked his shopping bags, new <br/>bias
          seam-binding, panels of stretchy Lycra to go under the plackets, a box of kosher salt. <br/>He had forgotten
          nothing. <br/></p>
        <p>In the workroom, he laid out his knives on a clean towel beside the long sinks. <br/>The knives were four: a
          sway-backed skinning knife, a delicate drop-point caper that <br/>perfectly followed the curve of the indent
          finger in close places, a scalpel for the closest <br/>work, and a World War I-era bayonet. The rolled edge of
          the bayonet is the finest tool for <br/>fleshing a hide without tearing it. <br/></p>
        <p>In addition he had a Strycker autopsy saw, which he hardly ever used and <br/>regretted buying. <br/></p>
        <p>Now he greased the head of a wig stand, packed coarse salt over the grease and <br/>set the stand in a
          shallow drip pan. Playfully he tweaked the nose on the face of the wig <br/>stand and blew it a kiss. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>It was hard to behave in a responsible manner--- he wanted to fly about the room <br/>like Danny Kaye. He
          laughed and blew a moth away from his face with a gentle puff of <br/>air. <br/></p>
        <p>Time to start the aquarium pumps in his fresh tanks of solution. Oh, was there a <br/>nice chrysalis buried
          in the humus in the cage? He poked with his finger. Yes, there was. <br/></p>
        <p>The pistol, now. <br/>The problem of killing this one had perplexed Mr. Gumb for days. Hanging her <br/></p>
        <p>was out because he didn't want the pectoral mottling, and besides, he couldn't risk the <br/>knot tearing her
          behind the ear. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb had learned from each of his previous efforts, sometimes painfully. He <br/>was determined to avoid
          some of the nightmares he'd gone through before. One cardinal <br/>principle: no matter how weak from hunger
          or faint with fright, they always fought you <br/>when they saw the apparatus. <br/></p>
        <p>He had in the past hunted young women through the blacked-out basement using <br/>his infrared goggles and
          light, and it was wonderful to do, watching them feel their way <br/>around, seeing them try to scrunch into
          corners. He liked to hunt them with the pistol. He <br/>liked to use the pistol. Always they became
          disoriented, lost their balance, ran into things. <br/>He could stand in absolute darkness with his goggles
          on, wait until they took their hands <br/>down from their faces, and shoot them right in the head. Or in the
          legs first, below the <br/>knee so they could still crawl. <br/></p>
        <p>That was childish and a waste. They were useless afterward and he had quit doing </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>it altogether. <br/>In his current project, he had offered showers upstairs to the first three, before he
        <br/></p>
        <p>booted them down the staircase with a noose around their necks--- no problem. But the <br/>fourth had been a
          disaster. He'd had to use the pistol in the bathroom and it had taken an <br/>hour to clean up. He thought
          about the girl, wet, goosebumps on her, and how she <br/>shivered when he cocked the pistol. He liked to cock
          it, snick snick, one big bang and no <br/>more racket. <br/></p>
        <p>He liked his pistol,, and well he should, because it was a very handsome piece, a <br/>stainless steel Colt
          Python with a six-inch barrel. All Python actions are tuned at the Colt <br/>custom shop, and this one was a
          pleasure to feel. He cocked it now and squeezed it off, <br/>catching the hammer with his thumb. He loaded the
          Python and put it on the workroom <br/>counter. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb wanted very much to offer this one a shampoo, because he wanted to <br/>watch it comb out the hair.
          He could learn much for his own grooming about how the hair <br/>lay on the head. But this one was tall and
          probably strong. This one was too rare to risk <br/>having to waste the whole thing with gunshot wounds. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>No, he'd get his hoisting tackle from the bathroom, offer her a bath, and when she <br/>had put herself
          securely in the hoisting sling he'd bring her halfway up the shaft of the <br/>oubliette and shoot her several
          times low in the spine. When she lost consciousness he <br/>could do the rest with chloroform. <br/></p>
        <p>That's it. He'd go upstairs now and get out of his clothes. He'd wake up Precious <br/>and watch his video
          with her and then go to work, naked in the warm basement, naked as <br/>the day he was born. <br/></p>
        <p>He felt almost giddy going up the stairs. Quickly out of his clothes and into his <br/>robe. He plugged in
          his videocassette. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Precious, come on Precious. Busybusy day. Come on, Sweetheart.&quot; He'd have to <br/>shut her up here
          in the upstairs bedroom while he got through with the noisy part in the <br/>basement--- she hated the noise
          and got terribly upset. To keep her occupied, he'd gotten <br/>her a whole box of Chew-eez while he was out
          shopping. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Precious.&quot; When she didn't come, he called in the hall, &quot;Precious!&quot; and then in <br/>the
          kitchen, and in the basement, &quot;Precious!&quot; When he called at the door of the oubliette <br/>room, he
          got an answer: <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;She's down here you son of a bitch,&quot; Catherine Martin said. <br/>Mr. Gumb sickened all over in a
          plunge of fear for Precious. Then rage tightened <br/></p>
        <p>him again and, fists against the sides of his head, he pressed his forehead into the <br/>doorframe and tried
          to get hold of himself. One sound between a retch and a groan <br/>escaped him and the little dog answered
          with a yip. <br/></p>
        <p>He went to the workroom and got his pistol. <br/>The string to the sanitation bucket was broken. He still
          wasn't sure how she'd done <br/></p>
        <p>it. Last time the string was broken, he'd assumed she'd broken it in an absurd attempt to <br/>climb. They
          had tried to climb it before--- they had done every fool thing imaginable. <br/></p>
        <p>He leaned over the opening, his voice carefully controlled. <br/>&quot;Precious, are you all right? Answer
          me.&quot; <br/>Catherine pinched the dog's plump behind. It yipped and paid her back with a nip <br/></p>
        <p>on the arm. <br/>&quot;How's that?&quot; Catherine said. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>It seemed very unnatural to Mr. Gumb to speak to Catherine in this way, but he <br/>overcame his distaste.
        <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'll lower a basket. You'll put her in it.&quot; <br/>&quot;You'll lower a telephone or I'll have to
          break her neck. I don't want to hurt you, I <br/></p>
        <p>don't want to hurt this little dog. Just give me the telephone.&quot; <br/>Mr. Gumb brought the pistol up.
          Catherine saw the muzzle extending past the <br/></p>
        <p>light. She crouched, holding the dog above her, weaving it between her and the gun. She <br/>heard him cock
          the pistol. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You shoot motherfucker you better kill me quick or I'll break her fucking neck. I <br/>swear to God.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>She put the dog under her arm, put her hand around its muzzle, raised its head. <br/>&quot;Back off, you son
          of a bitch.&quot; The little dog whined. The gun withdrew. <br/></p>
        <p>Catherine brushed the hair back from her wet forehead with her free hand. &quot;I <br/>didn't mean to insult
          you,&quot; she said. &quot;Just lower me a phone. I want a live phone. You can <br/>go away, I don't care
          about you, I never saw you. I'll take good care of Precious.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll see she has everything. Think about her welfare; not just yourself. You shoot
          <br/></p>
        <p>in here, she'll be deaf whatever happens. All I want's a live telephone. Get a long <br/>extension, get five
          or six and clip them together--- they come with the connections on the <br/>ends--- and lower it down here.
          I'd air-freight you the dog anywhere. My family has dogs. <br/>My mother loves dogs. You can run, I don't care
          what you do.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You won't get any more water, you've had your last water.'' <br/>&quot;She won't get any either, and I
          won't give her any from my water bottle. I'm sorry <br/></p>
        <p>to tell you, I think her leg's broken.&quot; This was a lie--- the lithe dog, along with the baited <br/>bucket,
          had fallen onto Catherine and it was Catherine who suffered a scratched cheek <br/>from the dog's scrabbling
          claw. She couldn't put it down or he'd see it didn't limp. &quot;She's <br/>in pain. Her leg's all crooked and
          she's trying to lick it. It just makes me sick,&quot; Catherine <br/>lied. &quot;I've got to get her to a vet.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb's groan of rage and anguish made the little dog cry. &quot;You think <i>she's</i> in <br/>pain,&quot;
          Mr. Gumb said. &quot;You don't know what pain is. You hurt her and I'll scald you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>When she heard him pounding up the stairs Catherine Martin sat down, shaken by <br/>gross jerks in her arms
          and legs. She couldn't hold the dog, she couldn't hold her water, <br/>she couldn't hold anything. <br/></p>
        <p>When the little dog climbed into her lap she hugged it, grateful far the warmth. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER
          50 <br/> <br/>F</b>eathers rode on the thick brown water, curled feathers blown from the coops, <br/></p>
        <p>carried on breaths of air that shivered the skin of the river. <br/>The houses on Fell Street, Fredrica
          Bimmel's street, were termed waterfront on <br/></p>
        <p>the weathered realtors' signs because their backyards ended at a slough, a backwater of <br/>the Licking
          River in Belvedere, Ohio, a Rust Belt town of 112,000, east of Columbus. <br/></p>
        <p>It was a shabby neighborhood of big, old houses. A few of them had been bought <br/>cheap by young couples
          and renovated with Sears Best enamel, making the rest of the <br/>houses look worse. The Bimmel house had not
          been renovated. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Clarice Starling stood for a moment in Fredrica's backyard looking at the feathers <br/>on the water, her
        hands deep in the pockets of her trenchcoat. There was some rotten <br/>snow in the reeds, blue beneath the blue
        sky on this mild winter day. <br/></p>
        <p>Behind her Starling could hear Fredrica's father hammering in the city, of pigeon-<br/>coops, the Orvieto of
          pigeon coops rising from the water's edge and reaching almost to <br/>the house. She hadn't seen Mr. Bimmel
          yet. <br/></p>
        <p>The neighbors said he was there. Their faces were closed when they said it. <br/>Starling was having some
          trouble with herself. At that moment in the night when <br/></p>
        <p>she knew she had to leave the Academy to hunt Buffalo Bill, a lot of extraneous noises <br/>had stopped. She
          felt a pure new silence in the center of her mind, and a calm there. In a <br/>different place, down the front
          of her, she felt in flashes that she was a truant and a fool. <br/></p>
        <p>The petty annoyances of the morning hadn't touched her--- not the gymnasium <br/>stink of the airplane to
          Columbus, not the confusion and ineptitude at the rental-car <br/>counter. She'd snapped at the car clerk to
          make him move, but she hadn't felt anything. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had paid a high price for this time and she meant to use it as she thought <br/>best. Her time could
          be up at any moment, if Crawford was overruled and they pulled her <br/>credentials. <br/></p>
        <p>She should hurry, but to think about why, to dwell on Catherine's plight on this <br/>final day, would be to
          waste the day entirely. To think of her in real time, being processed <br/>at this moment as Kimberly Emberg
          and Fredrica Bimmel had been processed, would <br/>jam all other thought. <br/></p>
        <p>The breeze fell off, the water still as death. Near her feet a curled feather spun on <br/>the surface
          tension. Hang on, Catherine. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling caught her lip between her teeth. If he shot her, she hoped he'd do a <br/>competent job of it.
          <br/></p>
        <p><i>Teach us to care and not to care. <br/>Teach us to be still. <br/></i>She turned to the leaning stack of
          coops and followed a path of boards laid on the <br/></p>
        <p>mud between them, toward the sound of hammering. The hundreds of pigeons were of all <br/>sizes and colors;
          there were tall knock-kneed ones and pouters with their chests stuck out. <br/>Eyes bright, heads jerking as
          they paced, the birds spread their wings in the pale sun and <br/>made pleasant sounds as she passed. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Fredrica's father, Gustav Bimmel, was a tall man, flat and wide-hipped with red-<br/>rimmed eyes of watery
          blue. A knit cap was pulled down to his eyebrows. He was <br/>building another coop on sawhorses in front of
          his work shed. Starling smelled vodka on <br/>his breath as he squinted at her identification. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I don't know nothing new to tell you,&quot; he said. &quot;The policemen come back here <br/>night
          before last. They went back over my statement with me again. Read it back to me. <br/>'Is that right? Is that
          right?' I told him, I said hell yes, if that wasn't right I wouldn't have <br/>told you in the first place.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I'm trying to get an idea where the--- get an idea where the kidnapper might have <br/>seen Fredrica,
          Mr. Bimmel. Where he might have spotted her and decided to take her <br/>away.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;She went into Columbus on the bus to see about a job at that store there. The <br/>police said she got
          to the interview all right. She never came home. We don't know where <br/>else she went that day, The FBI got
          her Master Charge slips, but there wasn't nothing for </p>

      </div>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>that day. You know all that, don't you?&quot; <br/>&quot;About the credit card, yes sir, I do. Mr. Bimmel,
        do you have Fredrica's things, <br/></p>
        <p>are they here? <br/>&quot;Her room's in the top of the house.&quot; <br/>&quot;May I see?&quot; <br/>It took
          him a moment to decide where to lay down his hammer. &quot;All right,&quot; he <br/></p>
        <p>said, &quot;come along.&quot; <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 51 <br/> <br/>J</b>ack Crawford's office in the
          FBI's Washington headquarters was painted an <br/></p>
        <p>oppressive gray, but it had big windows. <br/>Crawford stood at these windows with his clipboard held to the
          light, peering at a <br/></p>
        <p>list off a God damned fuzzy dot-matrix printer that he'd told them to get rid of. <br/>He'd come here from
          the funeral home and worked all morning, tweaking the <br/></p>
        <p>Norwegians to hurry with their dental records on the missing seaman named Klaus, <br/>jerking San Diego's
          chain to check Benjamin Raspail's familiars at the Conservatory <br/>where he had taught, and stirring up
          Customs, which was supposed to be checking for <br/>import violations involving living insects. <br/></p>
        <p>Within five minutes of Crawford's arrival, FBI Assistant Director John Golby, <br/>head of the new
          interservice task force, stuck his head in the office for a moment to say <br/>&quot;Jack, we're all thinking
          about you. Everybody appreciates you coming in. Has the <br/>service been set yet?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;The wake's tomorrow evening. Service is Saturday at eleven o'clock.&quot; <br/>Golby nodded. &quot;There's
          a UNICEF memorial, Jack, a fund. You want it to read <br/></p>
        <p>Phyllis or Bella, we'll do it any way you like.&quot; <br/>&quot;Bella, John. Let's make it Bella.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Can I do anything for you, Jack?&quot; <br/>Crawford shook his head. &quot;I'm just working. I'm
          just gonna work now.&quot; <br/>&quot;Right,&quot; Golby said. He waited the decent interval. &quot;Frederick
          Chilton asked for <br/></p>
        <p>federal protective custody.&quot; <br/>&quot;Grand. John, is somebody in Baltimore talking to Everett Yow,
          Raspail's lawyer? <br/></p>
        <p>I mentioned him to you. He might know something about Raspail's friends.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yeah, they're on it
          this morning. I just sent Burroughs my memo on it. The <br/></p>
        <p>Director's putting Lecter on the Most Wanted. Jack, if you need anything...&quot; Golby raised <br/>his
          eyebrows and his hand and backed out of sight. <br/></p>
        <p><i>If you need anything. <br/></i>Crawford turned to the windows. He had a fine view from his office. There
          was <br/></p>
        <p>the handsome old Post Office building where he'd done some of his training. To the left <br/>was the old FBI
          headquarters. At. graduation, he'd filed thibugh J. Edgar Hoover's office <br/>with the others. Hoover stood
          on a little box and shook their hands in turn. That was the <br/>only time Crawford ever met the man. The next
          day he married Bella. <br/></p>
        <p>They had met in Livorno, Italy. He was Army, she NATO staff, and she was <br/>Phyllis then. They walked on
          the quays and a boatman called &quot;Bella&quot; across the glittering <br/>water and she was always Bella to
          him after that. She was only Phyllis when they </p>

        <p>Thank God, Bella had saved him from that. He hoped she was somewhere today <br/>and that she was comfortable
          at last. He hoped she could see in his heart. <br/></p>
        <p>The phone was buzzing its intraoffice buzz. <br/>&quot;Mr. Crawford, a Dr. Danielson from---&quot; <br/>&quot;Right.&quot;
          Punch. &quot;Jack Crawford, Doctor.&quot; <br/>&quot;Is this line secure, Mr. Crawford?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.
          On this end it is.&quot; <br/>&quot;You're not taping, are you?&quot; <br/>&quot;No, Dr. Danielson. Tell me
          what's on your mind.&quot; <br/>&quot;I want to make it clear this has nothing to do with anybody who was ever
          a <br/></p>
        <p>patient at Johns Hopkins.&quot; <br/>&quot;Understood.&quot; <br/>&quot;If anything comes of it, I want you
          to make it clear to the public he's not a <br/></p>
        <p>transsexual, he had nothing to do with this institution.&quot; <br/>&quot;Fine. You got it. Absolutely.&quot;
          <i>Come on, you stuffy bastard. </i>Crawford would <br/></p>
        <p>have said anything. <br/>&quot;He shoved Dr. Purvis down.&quot; <br/>&quot;Who, Dr. Danielson?&quot; <br/>&quot;He
          applied to the program three years ago as John Grant of Harrisburg, <br/></p>
        <p>Pennsylvania.&quot; <br/>&quot;Description?&quot; <br/>&quot;Caucasian male, he was thirty-one. Six feet one,
          a hundred and ninety pounds. <br/></p>
        <p>He came to be tested and did very well on the Wechsler intelligence scale--- bright <br/>normal--- but the
          psychological testing and the interviews were another story. In fact, his <br/>House-Tree-Person and his TAT
          were spot-on with the sheet you gave me. You let me <br/>think Alan Bloom authored that little theory, but it
          was Hannibal Lecter, wasn't it?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Go on with Grant, Doctor.&quot; <br/>&quot;The board would have turned him down anyway, but by the time
          we met to <br/></p>
        <p>discuss it, the question was moot because the background checks got him.&quot; <br/>&quot;Got him how.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;We routinely check with the police in an applicant's hometown. The Harrisburg <br/></p>
        <p>police were after him for two assaults on homosexual men. The last one nearly died. He'd <br/>given us an
          address that turned out to be a boarding house he stayed in from time to time. <br/>The police got his
          fingerprints there and a credit-card gas receipt with his license number <br/>on it. His name wasn't John
          Grant at all, he'd just told us that. About a week later he <br/>waited outside the building here and shoved
          Dr. Purvis down, just for spite.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What was his name, Dr. Danielson?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'd better spell it for you, it's J-A-M-E G-U-M-B.&quot;

      <div><p><b>CHAPTER 52 <br/> <br/>F</b>redrica Bimmel's house was three stories tall and gaunt, covered with
        asphalt <br/></p>
        <p>shingles stained rusty where the gutters had spilled over. Volunteer maples growing in <br/>the gutters had
          stood up to the winter pretty well. The windows on the north side were <br/>covered with sheet plastic. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>In a small parlor, very warm from a space heater, a middle-aged woman sat on a <br/>rug, playing with an
          infant. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;My wife,&quot; Bimmel said as they passed through the room. &quot;We just got married <br/>Christmas.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Hello,&quot; Starling said. The woman smiled vaguely in her direction. <br/>Cold in the hall again and
          everywhere boxes stacked waist-high filling the rooms, <br/></p>
        <p>passageways among them, cardboard cartons filled with lampshades and canning lids, <br/>picnic hampers, back
          numbers of the <i>Reader's Digest</i> and <i>National Geographic, </i>thick old <br/>tennis rackets, bed
          linens, a case of dartboards, fiber car-seat covers in a fifties plaid with <br/>the intense smell of mouse
          pee. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;We're moving pretty soon,&quot; Mr. Bimmel said. <br/>The stuff near the windows was bleached by the
          sun, the boxes stacked for years <br/></p>
        <p>and bellied with age, the random rugs worn bare in the paths through the rooms. <br/>Sunlight dappled the
          bannister as Starling climbed the stairs behind Fredrica's <br/></p>
        <p>father. His clothes smelled stale in the cold air. She could see sunlight coming through <br/>the sagging
          ceiling at the top of the stairwell. The cartons stacked on the landing were <br/>covered with plastic. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Fredrica's room was small, under the eaves on the third floor. <br/>&quot;You want me anymore?&quot; <br/>&quot;Later,
          I'd like to talk to you, Mr. Bimmel. What about Fredrica's mother?&quot; The <br/></p>
        <p>file said &quot;deceased,&quot; it didn't say when. <br/>&quot;What do you mean, what about her? She died
          when Fredrica was twelve.&quot; <br/>&quot;I see.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did you think that was Fredrica's mother
          downstairs? After I told you we just <br/></p>
        <p>been married since Christmas? That what you thought is it? I guess the law's used to <br/>handling a
          different class of people, missy. She never knew Fredrica at all.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Mr. Bimmel, is the room pretty much like Fredrica left it?&quot; <br/>The anger wandered somewhere else
          In him. <br/>&quot;Yah,&quot; he said softly. &quot;We just left it alone. Nobody much could wear her stuff.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Plug in the heater if you want it. Remember and unplug it before you come down.&quot; <br/>He didn't want to
          see the room. He left her on the landing. <br/>Starling stood for a moment with her hand on the cold porcelain
          knob. She needed <br/></p>
        <p>to organize a little, before her head was full of Fredrica's things. <br/><i>Okay, the premise is Buffalo
          Bill did Fredrica first, weighted her and hid her well, <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>in a river far from home. He hid her better than the others--- she was the only one <br/>weighted---
          because he wanted the later ones found first. He wanted the idea of random <br/>selection of victims in widely
          scattered towns well established before Fredrica, of <br/>Belvedere, was found. It was important to take
          attention away from Belvedere. Because <br/>he lives here, or maybe in Columbus. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>He started with Fredrica because he coveted her hide. We don't begin to covet </i></p>

      <div><p><i>with imagined things. Coveting is a very literal sin--- we begin to covet with tangibles, we <br/>begin

        her daily life. <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>What was the course of Fredrica's daily life? All right... <br/></i>Starling pushed the door open. Here it
          was, this still room smelling of mildew in <br/></p>
        <p>the cold. On the wall, last year's calendar was forever turned to April. Fredrica had been <br/>dead ten
          months. <br/></p>
        <p>Cat food, hard and black, was in a saucer in the corner. <br/>Starling, veteran yard-sale decorator, stood in
          the center of the room and turned <br/></p>
        <p>slowly around. Fredrica had done a pretty good job with what she had. There were <br/>curtains of flowered
          chintz. Judging from the piped edges, she had recycled some <br/>slipcovers to make the curtains. <br/></p>
        <p>There was a bulletin board with a sash pinned to it. BHS BAND was printed on <br/>the sash in glitter. A
          poster of the performer Madonna was on the wall, and another of <br/>Deborah Harry and Blondie. On a shelf
          above the desk, Starling could see a roll of the <br/>bright self-adhesive wallpaper Fredrica had used to
          cover her walls. It was not a great job <br/>of papering; but better than her own first effort, Starling
          thought. <br/></p>
        <p>In an average home, Fredrica's room would have been cheerful. In this bleak <br/>house it was shrill; there
          was an echo of desperation in it. <br/></p>
        <p>Fredrica did not display photographs of herself in the room. <br/>Starling found one in the school yearbook
          on the small bookcase. Glee Club, <br/></p>
        <p>Home-Ec Club, Sew n' Sew, Band, 4-H Club--- maybe the pigeons served as her 4-H <br/>project. <br/></p>
        <p>Fredrica's school annual had some signatures. &quot;To a great pal,&quot; and a &quot;great gal&quot; <br/>and
          &quot;my chemistry buddy,&quot; and &quot;Remember the bake sale?!!&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Could Fredrica bring her friends up here? Did she have a friend good enough to <br/>bring up those stairs
          beneath the drip? There was an umbrella beside the door. <br/></p>
        <p>Look at this picture of Fredrica, here she's in the front row of the band. Fredrica is <br/>wide and fat, but
          her uniform fits better than the others. She's big and she has beautiful <br/>skin. Her irregular features
          combine to make a pleasant face; but she is not attractive <br/>looking by conventional standards. <br/></p>
        <p>Kimberly Emberg wasn't what you would call fetching either, not to the mindless <br/>gape of high school, and
          neither were a couple of the others. <br/></p>
        <p>Catherine Martin, though, would be attractive to anybody, a big, good-looking <br/>young woman who would have
          to fight the fat when she was thirty. <br/></p>
        <p>Remember, he doesn't look at women as a man looks at them. Conventionally <br/>attractive doesn't count. They
          just have to be smooth and roomy. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling wondered if he thought of women as &quot;skins,&quot; the way some cretins call <br/>them &quot;cunts.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>She became aware of her own hand tracing the line of credits beneath the <br/>yearbook picture, became aware
          of her entire body, the space she filled, her figure and <br/>her face, their effect, the power in them, her
          breasts above the book, her hard belly <br/>against it, her legs below it. What of her experience applied?
          <br/></p>
        <p>Starling saw herself in the full-length mirror on the end wall and was glad to be <br/>different from
          Fredrica. But she knew the difference was a matrix in her thinking. What <br/>might it keep her from seeing?
        </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>How did Fredrica want to appear? What was she hungry for, where did she seek <br/>it? What did she try to
        do about herself? <br/></p>
        <p>Here were a couple of diet plans, the Fruit Juice Diet, the Rice Diet, and a <br/>crackpot plan where you
          don't eat and drink at the same sitting. <br/></p>
        <p>Organized diet groups--- did Buffalo Bill watch them to find big girls? Hard to <br/>check. Starling knew
          from the file that two of the victims had belonged to diet groups and <br/>that the membership rosters had
          been compared. An agent from the Kansas City office, <br/>the FBI's traditional Fat Boys' Bureau, and some
          overweight police were sent around to <br/>work out at Slenderella, and Diet Center, and join Weight Watchers
          and other diet de-<br/>nominations in the victim's towns. She didn't know if Catherine Martin belonged to a
          diet <br/>group. Money would have been a problem for Fredrica in organized dieting. <br/></p>
        <p>Fredrica had several issues of <i>Big Beautiful Girl</i>, a magazine for large women. <br/>Here she was
          advised to &quot;come to New York City, where you can meet newcomers from <br/>parts of the world where your
          size is considered a prized asset.&quot; Right. Alternatively, <br/>&quot;you could travel to Italy or
          Germany, where you won't be alone after the first day.&quot; You <br/>bet. Here's what to do if your toes hang
          out over the ends of your shoes. Jesus! All <br/>Fredrica needed was to meet Buffalo Bill, who considered her
          size a &quot;prized asset.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>How did Fredrica manage? She had some makeup, a lot of skin stuff. Good for <br/>you, <i>use </i>that asset.
          Starling found herself rooting for Fredrica as though it mattered <br/>anymore. <br/></p>
        <p>She had some junk jewelry in a White Owl cigar box. Here was a gold-filled <br/>circle pin that most likely
          had belonged to her late mother. She'd tried to cut the fingers <br/>off some old gloves of machine lace, to
          wear them Madonna-style, but they'd raveled on <br/>her. <br/></p>
        <p>She had some music, a single-shot Decca record player from the fifties with a <br/>jackknife attached to the
          tone arm with rubber bands for weight. Yard-sale records. Love <br/>themes by Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute.
          <br/></p>
        <p>When she pulled the string to light the closet, Starling was surprised at Fredrica's <br/>wardrobe. She had
          nice clothes, not a great many, but plenty for school, enough to get <br/>along in a fairly formal office or
          even a dressy retail job. A quick look inside them, and <br/>Starling saw the reason. Fredrica made her own,
          and made them well, the seams were <br/>bound with a serger, the facings carefully fitted. Stacks of patterns
          were on a shelf at the <br/>back of the closet. Most of them were Simplicity, but there were a couple of
          Vogues that <br/>looked hard. <br/></p>
        <p>She probably wore her best thing to the job interview. What had she worn? <br/>Starling flipped through her
          file. Here: last seen wearing a green outfit. Come on, officer, <br/>what the hell is a &quot;green outfit?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>Fredrica suffered from the Achilles' heel of the budget wardrobe--- she was short <br/>on shoes--- and at her
          weight she was hard on the shoes she had. Her loafers were <br/>strained into ovals. She wore Odor-Eaters in
          her sandals. The eyelets were stretched in <br/>her running shoes. <br/></p>
        <p>Maybe Fredrica exercised a little--- she had some outsized warmups. <br/>They were made by Juno. <br/>Catherine
          Martin also had some fat pants made by Juno. <br/>Starling backed out of the closet. She sat on the foot of
          the bed with her arms <br/></p>
        <p>folded and stared into the lighted closet. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Juno was a common brand, sold in a lot of places that handle outsizes, but it <br/>raised the question of
        clothing. Every town of any size has at least one store specializing <br/>in clothes for fat people. <br/></p>
        <p>Did Buffalo Bill watch fat stores, select a customer and follow her? <br/>Did he go into oversize shops in
          drag and look around? Every oversize shop in a <br/></p>
        <p>city gets both transvestites and drag queens as customers. <br/>The idea of Buffalo Bill trying to cross over
          sexually had just been applied to the <br/></p>
        <p>investigation very recently, since Dr. Lecter gave Starling his theory. What about his <br/>clothes? <br/>
        </p>
        <p>All of the victims must have shopped in fat stores--- Catherine Martin would wear <br/>a twelve, but the
          others couldn't, and Catherine must have shopped in an oversize store to <br/>buy the big Juno sweats. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Catherine Martin could wear a twelve. She was the smallest of the victims. <br/>Fredrica, the first victim,
          was largest. How was Buffalo Bill managing to down-size with <br/>the choice of Catherine Martin? Catherine
          was plenty buxom, but she wasn't that big <br/>around. Had he lost weight himself? Might he have joined a diet
          group lately? Kimberly <br/>Emberg was sort of in-between, big, but with a good waist indention... <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had specifically avoided thinking about Kimberly Emberg, but now the <br/>memory swamped her for a
          second. Starling saw Kimberly on the slab in Potter. Buffalo <br/>Bill hadn't cared about her waxed legs, her
          carefully glittered fingernails: he looked at <br/>Kimberly's flat bosom and it wasn't good enough and he took
          his pistol and blew a <br/>starfish in her chest. <br/></p>
        <p>The door to the room pushed open a few inches. Starling felt the movement in her <br/>heart before she knew
          what it was. A cat came in, a large tortoiseshell cat with one eye <br/>gold, the other blue. It hopped up on
          the bed and rubbed against her. Looking for <br/>Fredrica. <br/></p>
        <p>Loneliness. Big lonesome girls trying to satisfy somebody. <br/>The police had eliminated lonely-hearts clubs
          early. Did Buffalo Bill have another <br/></p>
        <p>way to take advantage of loneliness? Nothing makes us more vulnerable than loneliness <br/>except greed.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Loneliness might have permitted Buffalo Bill an opening with Fredrica, but not <br/>with Catherine. Catherine
          wasn't lonesome. <br/></p>
        <p>Kimberly was lonesome. <i>Don't start this.</i> Kimberly, obedient and limp, past rigor <br/>mortis, being
          rolled over on the mortician's table so Starling could fingerprint her. <i>Stop it. <br/>Can't stop it. </i>Kimberly
          lonesome, anxious to please, had Kimberly ever rolled over <br/>obediently for someone, just to feel his heart
          beat against her back? She wondered if <br/>Kimberly had felt whiskers grating between her shoulder blades.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Staring into the lighted closet, Starling remembered Kimberly's plump back, the <br/>triangular patches of
          skin missing from her shoulders. <br/></p>
        <p>Staring into the lighted closet, Starling saw the triangles on Kimberly's shoulders <br/>outlined in the blue
          dashes of a dressmaking pattern. The idea swam away and circled <br/>and came again, came close enough for her
          to grab it this time and she did with a fierce <br/>pulse of joy: THEY'RE DARTS--- HE TOOK THOSE TRIANGLES TO
          MAKE <br/>DARTS SO HE COULD LET OUT HER WAIST. MOTHER FUCKER CAN SEW. <br/>BUFFALO BILL'S TRAINED TO SERIOUSLY
          SEW--- HE'S NOT JUST PICKING <br/>OUT READY-TO-WEAR. </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p><i>What did Dr. Lecter say? &quot;He's making himself a girl suit out of real girls.&quot; What <br/>did
        he say to me? &quot;Do you sew. Clarice?&quot; Damn straight I do. <br/></i></p>
        <p>Starling put her head back, closed her eyes for one second. Problem-solving is <br/>hunting; it is savage
          pleasure and we are born to it. <br/></p>
        <p>She'd seen a telephone in the parlor. She started downstairs to use it, but Mrs. <br/>Bimmel's reedy voice
          was calling up to her already, calling her to the phone. <br/></p>

          <br/>&quot;Good, Jerry, listen I think Buffalo Bill can sew. He cut the triangles--- just a sec-<br/></p>

        <p>&quot;Right, right, right, I'm punching up a line now to ID. Now listen up--- I may have <br/>to get off the
          phone here. Jack wanted me to brief you. We got a name and a place that <br/>looks not bad. The Hostage Rescue
          Team's airborne from Andrews. Jack's briefing them <br/>on the scrambler.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Going where?&quot; <br/>&quot;Calumet City, edge of Chicago. Subject's Jame, like 'Name' with a
          <i>J</i>, last name <br/></p>
        <p>Gumb, a.k.a. John Grant, WM, thirty-four, one-ninety, brown and blue. Jack got a beep <br/>from Johns
          Hopkins. Your thing--- your profile on how he'd be different from a <br/>transsexual--- it rang the cherries
          at Johns Hopkins. Guy applied for sex reassignment <br/>three years ago. Roughed up a doctor after they turned
          him down. Hopkins had the Grant <br/>alias and a flop address in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The cops had a gas
          receipt with his <br/>tag number and we went from there. Big jacket in California as a juvenile--- he killed
          his <br/>grandparents when he was twelve and did six years in Tulare Psychiatric. The state let <br/>him out
          sixteen years ago when they shut down the asylum. He disappeared a long time. <br/>He's a fag-basher. Had a
          couple of scrapes in Harrisburg and faded out again.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Chicago, you said. How do you know Chicago?&quot; <br/>&quot;Customs. They had some paper on the John
          Grant alias. Customs stopped a <br/></p>
        <p>suitcase at LAX a couple of years ago shipped from Surinam with live 'pupae'--- is that <br/>how you say
          it?--- insects anyway, moths, in it. The addressee was John Grant, care of a <br/>business in Calumet
          called--- get this--- called 'Mr. Hide.' Leather goods. Maybe the <br/>sewing fits with that; I'm relaying the
          sewing to Chicago and Calumet. No home address <br/>yet on Grant, or Gumb--- the business is closed, but we're
          close.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Any pictures?&quot; <br/>&quot;Just the juveniles from Sacramento PD so far. They're not much use--- he
          was </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>twelve. Looked like Beaver Cleaver. The wire room's faxing them around anyway. <br/>&quot;Can I go?&quot;
        <br/>&quot;No. Jack said you'd ask. They've got two female marshals from Chicago and a <br/></p>
        <p>nurse to take charge of Martin if they get her. You'd never be in time anyway, Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;What
          if he's barricaded? It could take---&quot; <br/>&quot;There won't be any standoff. They find him, they fall on
          him--- Crawford's <br/></p>
        <p>authorized an explosive entry. Special problems with this guy, Starling, he's been in a <br/>hostage
          situation before. His juvenile homicides, they got him in a barricade situation in <br/>Sacramento with his
          grandmother as hostage--- he'd already killed his grand-f already, <br/>but say we're lucky. Say he had a lot
          on his mind, one thing and another he didn't get <br/>around to it yet. If he sees us coming, he'll do her
          right in our faces for spite. Costs him <br/>nothing, right? So they find him and--- Boom!--- the door's down.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>The room was too damned hot and it smelled of baby ammonia. <br/>Burroughs was still talking. &quot;We're
          looking for both names on the entomology <br/></p>
        <p>magazine subscription lists, Knifemakers Guild, known offenders, the works--- nobody <br/>stands down until
          it's over. You're doing Bimmel's acquaintances, right?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Right.&quot; <br/>&quot;Justice says it's a tricky case to make if we don't catch him dirty. We need
          him <br/></p>
        <p>with Martin or with something identifiable--- something with teeth or fingers, frankly. <br/>Goes without
          saying, if he's dumped Martin already, we need witnesses to put him with a <br/>victim before the fact. We can
          use your stuff from Bimmel regardless... Starling, I wish to <br/>God this had happened yesterday for more
          reasons than the Martin kid. They throw the <br/>switch on you at Quantico?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I think so. They put in somebody else that was waiting out a recycle--- that's <br/>what they tell me.&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;If we get him in Chicago, you made a lot of contribution here. They're hardasses <br/>at Quantico like
          they're supposed to be, but they have to see <i>that. </i>Wait a minute.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Starling could hear Burroughs barking, away from the phone. Then he was back <br/>again. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Nothing--- they can deploy in Calumet City in forty to fifty-five, depends on the <br/>winds aloft.
          Chicago SWAT's deputized in case they find him sooner. Calumet Power <br/>and Light's come up with four
          possible addresses. Starling, watch for anything they can <br/>use up there to narrow it down. You see
          anything about Chicago or Calumet, get to me <br/>fast.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Righto.&quot; <br/>&quot;Now listen--- this and I gotta go. If it happens, if we get him in Calumet
          City, <br/></p>
        <p>you fall in at Quantico 0800 <i>ma&#241;ana </i>with your Mary Janes shined. Jack's going before <br/>the
          board with you. So is the chief gunny, Brigham. It don't hurt to ask.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Jerry, one other thing: Fredrica Bimmel had some warmups made by Juno, it's a <br/>brand of fat
          clothes. Catherine Martin had some too, for what it's worth. He might watch <br/>fat stores to find large
          victims. We could ask Memphis, Akron, the other places.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Got it. Keep smiling.&quot; <br/>Starling walked out in the junky yard in Belvedere, Ohio, 380 long
          miles from the <br/></p>
        <p>action in Chicago. The cold air felt good on her face. She threw a small punch, in the air, <br/>rooting hard
          for the Hostage Rescue Team. At the same time, she felt a little trembly in <br/>her chin and cheeks. What the
          hell was this? What the hell would she have done if she'd </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>found anything? She'd have called the cavalry, the Cleveland field office, and Columbus <br/>SWAT, the
        Belvedere PD too. <br/></p>
        <p>Saving the young woman, saving the daughter of Senator Fuck-You Martin and <br/>the ones that might come
          after--- truly, that was what mattered. If they did it, everybody <br/>was right. <br/></p>
        <p>If they weren't in time, if they found something awful, please God they got Buffa-<br/>-- got Jame Gumb or
          Mr. Hide or whatever they wanted to call the damned thing. <br/></p>
        <p>Still, to be so close, to get a hand on the rump of it, to have a good idea a day late <br/>and wind up far
          from the arrest, busted out of school, it all smacked of losing. Starling <br/>had long suspected, guiltily,
          that the Starlings' luck had been sour for a couple of hundred <br/>years now--- that all the Starlings had
          been wandering around pissed off and confused <br/>back through the mists of time. That if you could find the
          tracks of the first Starling, they <br/>would lead in a circle. This was classic loser thinking, and she was
          damned if she'd <br/>entertain it. <br/></p>
        <p>If they caught him because of the profile she'd gotten from Dr. Lecter, it had to <br/>help her with the
          Department of Justice. Starling had to think about that a little; her career <br/>hopes were twitching like a
          phantom limb. <br/></p>
        <p>Whatever happened, having the flash on the dressmaking pattern had felt nearly <br/>as good as anything ever
          had. There was stuff to keep here. She'd found courage in the <br/>memory of her mother as well as her father.
          She'd earned and kept Crawford's <br/>confidence. These were things to keep iii her own White Owl cigar box.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Her job, her duty, was to think about Fredrica and how Gumb might have gotten <br/>her. A criminal
          prosecution of Buffalo Bill would require all the facts. <br/></p>
        <p>Think about Fredrica, stuck here all her young life. Where would she look for the <br/>exit? Did her longings
          resonate with Buffalo Bill's? Did that draw them together? Awful <br/>thought, that he might have understood
          her out of his own experience; empathized even, <br/>and still helped himself to her skin. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling stood at the edge of the water. <br/>Almost every place has a moment of the day, an angle and
          intensity of light, in <br/></p>
        <p>which it looks its best. When you're stuck someplace, you learn that time and you look <br/>forward to it.
          This, midafternoon, was probably the time for the Licking River behind <br/>Fell Street. Was this the Bimmel
          girl's time to dream? The pale sun raised enough vapor <br/>off the water to blur the old refrigerators and
          ranges dumped in the brush on the far side <br/>of the backwater. The northeast wind, opposite the light,
          pushed the cattails toward the <br/>sun. <br/></p>
        <p>A piece of white PVC pipe led from Mr. Bimmel's shed toward the river. It <br/>gurgled and a brief rush of
          bloody water came out, staining the old snow. Bimmel came <br/>out into the sun. The front of his trousers was
          flecked with blood and he carried some <br/>pink and gray lumps in a plastic food bag. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Squab,&quot; he said, when he saw Starling looking. &quot;Ever eat squab?&quot; <br/>&quot;No,&quot;
          Starling said, turning back to the water, &quot;I've eaten doves.&quot; <br/>&quot;Never have to worry about
          biting on a shot in these.&quot; <br/>&quot;Mr. Bimmel, did - Fredrica know anybody from Calumet City or the
          Chicago <br/></p>
        <p>area?&quot; <br/>He shrugged and shook his head. <br/>&quot;Had she ever been to Chicago, to your knowledge?&quot;

        don't know it? She didn't go to <i>Columbus </i>I didn't know it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did she know any men that sew, tailors or sailmakers?&quot; <br/>&quot;She sewed for everybody. She
          could sew like her mother. I don't know of any <br/></p>
        <p>men. She sewed for stores, for ladies, I don't know who.&quot; <br/>&quot;Who was her best friend, Mr.
          Bimmel? Who did she hang out with?&quot; <i>Didn't <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>mean to say &quot;hang. &quot; Good, it didn't slick him--- he's just pissed off. <br/></i>&quot;She
          didn't hang out like the good-for-nothings. She always had some work. God <br/></p>
        <p>didn't make her pretty, he made her busy.&quot; <br/>&quot;Who would you say was her best friend?&quot; <br/>&quot;Stacy
          Hubka, I guess, since they were little. Fredrica's mother, used to say Stacy <br/></p>
        <p>went around with Fredrica just to have somebody to wait on her, I don't know.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you know
          where I could get in touch with her?&quot; <br/>&quot;Stacy worked at the insurance, I guess she still does.
          The Franklin Insurance.&quot; <br/>Starling walked to her car across the rutted yard, her head down, hands
          deep in <br/></p>
        <p>her pockets. Fredrica's cat watched her from the high window. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 54 <br/> <br/>F</b>BI
          credentials get a snappier response the farther west you go. Starling's ID, <br/></p>
        <p>which might have raised one bored eyebrow on a Washington functionary, got the <br/>undivided attention of
          Stacy Hubka's boss at the Franklin Insurance Agency in Belvedere, <br/>Ohio. He relieved Stacy Hubka at the
          counter and the telephones himself, and offered <br/>Starling the privacy of his cubicle for the interview.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Stacy Hubka had a round, downy face and stood five-four in heels. She wore her <br/>hair in frosted wings and
          used a Cher Bono move to brush them back from her face. She <br/>looked Starling up and down whenever Starling
          wasn't facing her. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Stacy--- may I call you Stacy?&quot; <br/>&quot;Sure.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'd like you to tell me, Stacy,
          how you think this might have happened to <br/></p>
        <p>Fredrica Bimmel--- where this man might have spotted Fredrica.&quot; <br/>&quot;Freaked me <i>out</i>. Get
          your <i>skin </i>peeled off, is that a bummer? Did you see her? <br/></p>
        <p>They said she was just like <i>rags, </i>like somebody let the air out of---&quot; <br/>&quot;Stacy, did she
          ever mention anybody from Chicago or Calumet City?&quot; <br/><i>Calumet City. The clock above Stacy Hubka's

          <br/></p>
        <p>and back on the bus.&quot; <br/>&quot;What did you think last spring when she first disappeared?&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          just didn't know.&quot; <br/>&quot;Remember where you were when you first found it out? When you got the news?

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>What did you think then?&quot; <br/>&quot;That first night she was gone, Skip and me went to the show and
        then we went to <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Toad's for a drink and Pam and them, Pam Malavesi, came in, and said Fredrica had <br/>disappeared, and
          Skip does, <i>Houdini </i>couldn't make Fredrica disappear. And then he's got <br/>to tell everybody who
          Houdini was, he's always showing off how much he knows, and <br/>we just sort of blew it off. I thought she
          was just mad at her dad. Did you <i>see </i>her house? <br/>Is <i>that </i>the pits? I mean, wherever she is,
          I know she's embarrassed you saw it. Wouldn't <br/><i>you </i>run away?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>''Did you think maybe she'd run away <i>with </i>somebody, did anybody pop into your <br/>mind--- even if it
          was wrong?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Skip said maybe she'd found her a chubby-chaser. But no, she never had <br/>anybody like that. She had
          one boyfriend, but that's like ancient history. He was in the <br/>band in the tenth grade, I say 'boyfriend'
          but they just talked and giggled like a couple of <br/>girls and did homework. He was a big sissy though, wore
          one of these little Greek <br/>fisherman's caps? Skip thought he was a, you know, a queer. She got kidded
          about going <br/>out with a queer. Him and his sister got killed in a car wreck though, and she never got
          <br/>anybody else.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;What did you think when she didn't come back?&quot; <br/>&quot;Pam thought maybe it was some Moonies
          got her, I didn't know, I was scared <br/></p>
        <p>every time I thought about it. I wouldn't any more go out at night without Skip, I told <br/>him, I said
          uh-uh, buddy, when the sun goes down, <i>we </i>go out.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did you ever hear her mention anybody named Jame Gumb? Or John Grant?&quot; <br/>&quot;Ummmm . . . no.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Do you think she could have had a friend you didn't know about? Were there <br/></p>
        <p>gaps in time, days when you didn't see her?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. She had a guy, I'd of known, believe me. She
          never had a guy.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you think it might be just possible, let's say, she could have had a
          friend and <br/></p>
        <p>didn't say anything about it?&quot; <br/>&quot;Why wouldn't she?&quot; <br/>&quot;Scared she'd get kidded,
          maybe?&quot; <br/>&quot;Kidded by us? What are you saying, because of the other time? The sissy kid in <br/>
        </p>
        <p>high school?&quot; Stacy reddened. &quot;No. No way we would hurt her. I just mentioned that <br/>together.
          She didn't... everybody was like, <i>kind </i>to her after he died.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did you work with Fredrica, Stacy?&quot; <br/>&quot;Me and her and Pam Malavesi and Jaronda Askew all
          worked down at the <br/></p>
        <p>Bargain Center summers in high school. Then Pam and me went to Richards' to see could <br/>we get on, it's
          real nice clothes, and they hired me and then Pam, so Pam says to Fredrica <br/>come on they need another girl
          and she came, but Mrs. Burdine--- the merchandising <br/>manager?--- she goes, 'Well, Fred<i>rica</i>, we need
          somebody that, you know, people can <br/>relate to, that they come in and say I want to look like <i>her</i>,
          and you can give them <br/>advice,how they look in this and stuff. And if you get yourself together and lose
          your <br/>weight I want you to come right back here and see me,' she says. 'But right now, if you <br/>want to
          take over some of our alterations I'll try you at that, I'll put in a word with Mrs. <br/>Lippman.' Mrs.
          Burdine talked in this sweety voice but she turned out to be a bitch really, <br/>but I didn't know it right
          at first.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So Fredrica did alterations for Richards', the store where you worked?&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;It hurt her feelings, but sure. Old Mrs. Lippman did everybody's alterations. She <br/>had the
        business and she had more than she could do, and Fredrica worked for her. She <br/>did them for old Mrs.
        Lippman. Mrs. Lippman sewed for everybody, made dresses. After <br/>Mrs. Lippman retired, her kid or whatever
        didn't want to do it and Fredrica got it all and <br/>just kept sewing for everybody. That's all she did. She'd
        meet me and Pam, we'd go to <br/>Pam's house on lunch and watch 'The Young and the Restless' and she'd bring
        something <br/>and be working in her lap the whole time.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did Fredrica ever work at the store, taking measurements? Did she meet <br/>customers or the wholesale
          people?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Sometimes, not much. I didn't work every day.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did Mrs. Burdine work every day, would
          she know?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yeah, I guess.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did Fredrica ever mention sewing for a company
          called Mr. Hide in Chicago or <br/></p>
        <p>Calumet City, maybe lining leather goods?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't know, Mrs. Lippman might have.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did
          you ever see the Mr. Hide brand? Did Richards' ever carry it, or one of the <br/></p>
        <p>boutiques?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>&quot;Do you know where Mrs. Lippman is? I'd like to talk to her.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;She died. She went to Florida to retire and she died down there, Fredrica said. I <br/></p>
        <p>never did know her, me and Skip just picked up Fredrica over there sometimes when she <br/>had a bunch of
          clothes. You might could talk to her family or something. I'll write it <br/>down for you.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>This was extremely tedious, when what Starling wanted was news from Calumet <br/>City. Forty minutes was up.
          The Hostage Rescue Team ought to be on the ground. She <br/>shifted so she didn't have to look at the clock,
          and pressed on. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Stacy, where did Fredrica buy clothes, where did she get those oversize Juno <br/>workout clothes, the
          sweats?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;She made just about everything. I expect she got the sweats at Richards', you <br/>know, when everybody
          started wearing them real big, so they came down over tights like <br/>that? A lots of places carried them
          then. She got a discount at Richards' because she <br/>sewed for them.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Did she ever shop at an oversize store?&quot; <br/>&quot;We went in every place to look, you know how
          you do. We'd go in Personality <br/></p>
        <p>Plus and she'd look for ideas, you know, flattering patterns for big sizes.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did anybody ever
          come up and bug you around an oversize store, or did Fredrica <br/></p>
        <p>ever feel somebody had his eye on her?&quot; <br/>Stacy looked at the ceiling for a second and shook her
          head. <br/>&quot;Stacy, did transvestites ever come into Richards', or men buying large dresses, <br/></p>
        <p>did you ever run into that?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. Me and Skip saw some at a bar in Columbus one time.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Was Fredrica with you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Not <i>hardly</i>. We'd gone, like, for the weekend.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Would you write down the oversize places you went with Fredrica, do you think <br/></p>
        <p>you could remember all of them?&quot; <br/>&quot;Just here, or here and Columbus?&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;Here and Columbus. And Richards' too, I want to talk to Mrs. Burdine.&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay. Is it a
        pretty good job, being a FBI agent?&quot; <br/>&quot;I think it is.&quot; <br/>&quot;You get to travel around
        and stuff? I mean places better than this.&quot; <br/>&quot;Sometimes you do.&quot; <br/>&quot;Got to look good
        every day, right?&quot; <br/>&quot;Well, yeah. You have to try to look businesslike.&quot; <br/>&quot;How do you
        get into that, being a FBI agent?&quot; <br/>&quot;You have to go to college first, Stacy.&quot; <br/>&quot;That's
        tough to pay for.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yeah, it is. Sometimes there are grants and fellowships that help out,
        though. <br/></p>
        <p>Would you like me to send you some stuff?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yeah. I was just thinking, Fredrica was so <i>happy </i>for
          me when I got this job. She <br/></p>
        <p>really got her rocks off--- she never had a real office job--- she thought this was getting <br/>somewhere.
          <i>This</i>--- cardboard files and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day--- she <br/>thought it was hot shit.
          What did she know, big dummy.&quot; Tears stood in Stacy Hubka's <br/>eyes. She opened them wide and held her
          head back to keep from having to do her eyes <br/>over. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;How about my list now?&quot; <br/>&quot;I better do it at my desk, I got my word processor and I need
          my phone book and <br/></p>
        <p>stuff.&quot; She went out with her head back, navigating by the ceiling. <br/>It was the telephone that was
          tantalizing Starling. The moment Stacy Hubka was <br/></p>
        <p>out of the cubicle, Starling called Washington collect to get the news. <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 55</b>
          <br/> <br/><b>A</b>t that moment, over the southern tip of Lake Michigan, a twenty-four passenger <br/></p>
        <p>business jet with civilian markings came off maximum cruise and began the long curve <br/>down to Calumet
          City, Illinois. <br/></p>
        <p>The twelve men of the Hostage Rescue Team felt the lift in their stomachs. There <br/>were a few elaborately
          casual tension yawns up and down the aisle. <br/></p>
        <p>Team commander Joel Randall, at the front of the passenger compartment, took <br/>off the headset and glanced
          over his notes before he got up to talk. He believed he had the <br/>best-trained SWAT team in the world, and
          he may have been right. Several of them had <br/>never been shot at, but as far as simulations and tests could
          tell, these were the best of the <br/>best. <br/></p>
        <p>Randall had spent a lot of time in airplane aisles, and kept his balance easily in the <br/>bumpy descent.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Gentlemen, our ground transportation's courtesy of DEA undercover. They've <br/>got a florist's truck
          and a plumbing van. So Vernon, Eddie, into your long handles and <br/>your civvies. If we go in behind stun
          grenades, remember you've got no flash protection <br/>on your faces.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Vernon muttered to Eddie, &quot;Make sure you cover up your cheeks.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did he say don't moon? I
          thought he said don't flash,&quot; Eddie murmured back. <br/>Vernon and Eddie, who would make the initial
          approach to the door, had to wear </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>thin ballistic armor beneath civilian clothes. The rest could go in hardshell armor, proof <br/>against
        rifle fire. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Bobby, make sure and put one of your handsets in each van for the driver, so we <br/>don't get fucked
          up talking to those DEA guys,&quot; Randall said. <br/></p>
        <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration uses UHF radios in raids, while the FBI <br/>has VHF. There had been
          problems in the past. <br/></p>
        <p>They were equipped for most eventualities, day or night: for walls they had basic <br/>rappelling equipment,
          to listen they had Wolf's Ears and a VanSleek Farfoon, to see they <br/>had night-vision devices. The weapons
          with night scopes looked like band instruments in <br/>their bulging cases. <br/></p>
        <p>This was to be a precise surgical operation and the weapons reflected it--- there <br/>was nothing that fired
          from an open bolt. <br/></p>
        <p>The team shrugged into their web gear as the flaps went down. <br/>Randall got news from Calumet on his
          headset. He covered the microphone and <br/></p>
        <p>spoke to the team again. &quot;Guys, they got it down to two addresses. We take the best one <br/>and Chicago
          SWAT's on the other.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The field was Lansing Municipal, the closest to Calumet on the southeast side of <br/>Chicago. The plane was
          cleared straight in. The pilot brought it to a stop in a stink of <br/>brakes beside two vehicles idling at
          the end of the field farthest from the terminal. <br/></p>
        <p>There were quick greetings beside the florist's truck. The DEA commander <br/>handed Randall what looked like
          a tall flower arrangement. It was a twelve-pound door-<br/>buster sledgehammer, the head wrapped in colored
          foil like a flowerpot, foliage attached <br/>to the handle. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;You might want to deliver this,&quot;, he said. &quot;Welcome to Chicago.&quot; <br/> <br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER
          56 <br/> <br/>M</b>r. Gumb went ahead with it in the late afternoon. <br/>With dangerous steady tears standing
          in his eyes, he'd watched his video again <br/></p>
        <p>and again and again. On the small screen, Mom climbed the waterslide and whee down <br/>into the pool, whee
          down into the pool. Tears blurred Jame Gumb's vision as though he <br/>were in the pool himself. <br/></p>
        <p>On his middle a hot-water bottle gurgled, as the little dog's stomach had gurgled <br/>when she lay on him.
          <br/></p>
        <p>He couldn't stand it any longer--- what he had in the basement holding Precious <br/>prisoner, threatening
          her. Precious was in pain, he knew she was. He wasn't sure he could <br/>kill it before it fatally injured
          Precious, but he had to try. Right now. <br/></p>
        <p>He took off his clothes and put on the robe--- he always finished a harvest naked <br/>and bloody as a
          newborn. <br/></p>
        <p>From his vast medicine cabinet he took the salve he had used on Precious when <br/>the cat scratched her. He
          got out some little Band-Aids and Q-tips and the plastic <br/>&quot;Elizabethan collar&quot; the vet gave him
          to keep her from worrying a sore place with her <br/>teeth. He had tongue depressors in the basement to use
          for splints on her little broken leg, <br/>and a tube of Sting-Eez to take the hurt away if the stupid thing
          scratched her thrashing <br/>around before it died. </p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>A careful head shot, and he'd just sacrifice the hair. Precious was worth more to <br/>him than the hair.
        The hair was a sacrifice, an offering for her safety. <br/></p>
        <p>Quietly down the stairs now, to the kitchen. Out of his slippers and down the dark <br/>basement stairs,
          staying close to the wall to keep the stairs from creaking. <br/></p>
        <p>He didn't turn on the light. At the bottom of the stairs, he took a right into the <br/>workroom, moving by
          touch in the familiar dark, feeling the floor change under his feet. <br/></p>
        <p>His sleeve brushed the cage and he heard the soft angry chirp of a brood moth. <br/>Here was the cabinet. He
          found his infrared light and slipped the goggles on his head. <br/>Now the world glowed green. He stood for a
          moment in the comforting burble of the <br/>tanks, in the warm hiss of the steam pipes. Master of the dark,
          queen of the dark. <br/></p>
        <p>Moths free in the air left green trails of fluorescence across his vision, faint <br/>breaths across his face
          as their downy wings brushed the darkness. <br/></p>
        <p>He checked the Python. It was loaded with .38 Special lead wad-cutters. They <br/>would slam into the skull
          and expand for an instant kill. If it was standing when he shot, <br/>if he shot down into the top of the
          head, the bullet was less likely than a Magnum load to <br/>exit the lower jaw and tear the bosom. <br/></p>
        <p>Quiet, quiet he crept, knees bent, painted toes gripping the old boards. Silent on <br/>the sand floor of the
          oubliette room. Quiet but not too slow. He didn't want his scent to <br/>have time to reach the little dog in
          the bottom of the well. <br/></p>
        <p>The top of the oubliette glowed green, the stones and mortar distinct, the grain of <br/>the wooden cover
          sharp in his vision. Hold the light and lean over. There they were. It <br/>was on its side like a giant
          shrimp. Perhaps asleep. Precious was curled up close against <br/>its body, surely sleeping, oh please not
          dead. <br/></p>
        <p>The head was exposed. A neck shot was tempting--- save the hair. Too risky. <br/>Mr. Gumb leaned over the
          hole, the stalk-eyes of his goggles peering down. The <br/></p>
        <p>Python has a good, muzzle-heavy feel, wonderfully pointable it is. Have to hold it in the <br/>beam of
          infrared. He lined up the sights on the side of'its head, just where the hair was <br/>damp against the
          temple. <br/></p>
        <p>Noise or smell, he never knew--- but Precious up and yipping, jumping straight up <br/>in the dark, Catherine
          Baker Martin doubling around the little dog and pulling the futon <br/>over them. Just lumps moving under the
          futon, he couldn't tell what was dog and what <br/>was Catherine. Looking down in infrared, his depth
          perception was impaired. He couldn't <br/>tell which lumps were Catherine. <br/></p>
        <p>But he had seen Precious jump. He knew her leg was all right, and at once he <br/>knew something more:
          Catherine Baker Martin wouldn't hurt the dog, any more than he <br/>would. Oh, sweet relief: Because of their
          shared feeling, he could shoot her in the God <br/>damned legs and when she clutched her legs, blow her
          fucking head off. No caution <br/>necessary. <br/></p>
        <p>He turned on the lights, all the damned lights in the basement, and got the <br/>floodlight from the
          storeroom. He had control of himself, he was reasoning well--- on his <br/>way through the workroom he
          remembered to run a little water in the sinks so nothing <br/>would clot in the traps. <br/></p>
        <p>As he hurried past the stairs, ready to go, carrying the floodlight, the doorbell <br/>rang. <br/></p>
        <p>The doorbell grating, rasping, he had to stop and think about what it was. He <br/>hadn't heard it in years,
          hadn't even known whether it worked. Mounted in the stairway so </p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>it could be heard upstairs and down, clanging now, a black metal tit covered with dust. <br/>As he looked
        at it, it rang again, kept ringing, dust flying off it. Someone was at the front, <br/>pushing the old button
        marked SUPERINTENDENT. <br/></p>
        <p>They would go away. <br/>He rigged the floodlight. <br/>They didn't go away. <br/>Down in the well, it said
          something he paid no attention to. The bell was clanging, <br/></p>
        <p>grating, they were just leaning on the button. <br/>Better go upstairs and peek out the front. The
          long-barreled Python wouldn't go in <br/></p>
        <p>the pocket of his robe. He put it on the workroom counter. <br/>He was halfway up the stairs when the bell
          stopped ringing. He waited a few <br/></p>
        <p>moments halfway up. Silence. He decided to look anyway. As he went through the <br/>kitchen a heavy knock on
          the back door made him jump. In the pantry near the back door <br/>was a pump shotgun. He knew it was loaded.
          <br/></p>
        <p>With the door closed to the basement stairs, nobody could hear it yelling down <br/>there, even at the top of
          its voice, he was sure of that. <br/></p>
        <p>Banging again. He opened the door a crack on the chain. <br/>&quot;I tried the front but nobody came,&quot;
          Clarice Starling said. &quot;I'm looking for Mrs. <br/></p>
        <p>Lippman's family, could you help me?&quot; <br/>&quot;They don't live here,&quot; Mr. Gumb said, and closed
          the door. He had started for the <br/></p>
        <p>stairs, again when the banging resumed, louder this time. <br/>He opened the door on the chain. <br/>The
          young woman held an ID close to the crack. It said Federal Bureau of <br/></p>
        <p>Investigation. &quot;Excuse me, but I need to talk to you. I want to find the family of Mrs. <br/>Lippman. I
          know she lived here. I want you to help me, please.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Mrs. Lippman's been dead for ages. She didn't have any relatives that I know of.&quot; <br/>&quot;What
          about a lawyer, or an accountant? Somebody who'd have her business <br/></p>
        <p>records? Did you know Mrs. Lippman?&quot; <br/>&quot;Just briefly. What's the problem?&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm
          investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?&quot; <br/>&quot;Jack Gordon.&quot; <br/>&quot;Did
          you know Fredrica Bimmel when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?&quot; <br/>&quot;No. Was she a great, fat person? I
          may have seen her, I'm not sure. I didn't mean <br/></p>
        <p>to be rude--- I was sleeping... Mrs. Lippman had a lawyer, I may have his card <br/>somewhere, I'll see if I
          can find it. Do you mind stepping in? I'm freezing and my cat will <br/><i>streak </i>through here in a
          second. She'll be outside like a shot before I can catch her.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>He went to a rolltop desk in the far corner of the kitchen, raised the top and <br/>looked in a couple of
          pigeonholes. Starling stepped inside the door and took her notebook <br/>out of her purse. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That horrible business,&quot; he said, rummaging the desk. &quot;I shiver every time I think <br/>about
          it. Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Not yet, but we're working. Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. <br/>Lippman died?&quot;
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Gumb bent over the desk, his back to Starling. He opened a drawer and <br/>poked around in
          it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Were there any records left here? Business records?&quot; </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>&quot;No, nothing at all. Does the FBI have any ideas? The police here don't seem to <br/>know the first
        thing. Do they have a description, or fingerprints?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Out of the folds in the back of Mr. Gumb's robe crawled a Death's-head Moth. It <br/>stopped in the center of
          his back, about where his heart would be, and adjusted its wings. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling dropped her notebook into the bag. <br/><i>Mister Gumb. Thank God my coat's open. Talk out of here,
          go to a phone. No. He <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>knows I'm FBI, I let him out of my sight he'll kill her. Do her kidneys. They find him, they <br/>fall on
          him. His phone. Don 't see it. Not in here, ask for his phone. Get the connection, <br/>then throw down on
          him. Make him lie facedown, wait for the cops. That's it, do it. He's <br/>turning around. <br/></i></p>
        <p>&quot;Here's the number,&quot; he said. He had a business card. <br/>Take it? No. <br/>&quot;Good, thank you.
          Mr. Gordon, do you have a telephone I could use?&quot; <br/>As he put the card on the table, the moth flew. It
          came from behind him, past his <br/></p>
        <p>head and lit between them, on a cabinet above the sink. <br/>He looked at it. When she didn't look at it,
          when her eyes never left his face, he <br/></p>
        <p>knew. <br/>Their eyes met and they knew each other. <br/>Mr. Gumb tilted his head a little to the side. He
          smiled. &quot;I have a cordless phone <br/></p>
        <p>in the pantry, I'll get it for you.&quot; <br/><i>No! Do it. </i>She went for the gun, one smooth move she'd
          done four thousand times <br/></p>
        <p>and it was right where it was supposed to be; good two-hand hold, her world the front <br/>sight and the
          center of his chest. &quot;Freeze.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>He pursed his lips. <br/>&quot;Now. Slowly. Put up your hands.&quot; <br/><i>Move him outside, keep the table
          between us. Walk him to the front. Facedown in <br/></i></p>
        <p><i>the middle of the street and hold up the badge. <br/></i>&quot;Mr. Gub--- Mr. Gumb, you're under arrest. I
          want you to walk slowly outside for <br/></p>
        <p>me.&quot; <br/>Instead, he walked out of the room. If he had reached for his pocket, reached <br/></p>
        <p>behind him, if she'd seen a weapon, she could have fired. He just walked out of the room. <br/>She heard him
          down the basement stairs fast, she around the table and to the door <br/></p>
        <p>at the top of the stairwell. He was gone, the stairwell brightly lit and empty. <i>Trap</i>. Be a <br/>sitting
          duck on the stairs. <br/></p>
        <p>From the basement then a thin paper cut of a scream. <br/>She didn't like the stairs, didn't like the stairs,
          Clarice Starling in the quick where <br/></p>
        <p>you give it or you don't. <br/>Catherine Martin screamed again, he's killing her and Starling went down them
          <br/></p>
        <p>anyway, one hand on the bannister, gun arm out the gun just under her line of vision, <br/>floor below
          bounding over the gunsight, gun arm swinging with her head as she tried to <br/>cover the two facing doors
          open at the bottom of the staircase. <br/></p>
        <p>Lights blazing in the basement, she couldn't go through one door without turning <br/>her back on the other,
          do it quick then, to the left toward the scream. Into the sand-floored <br/>oubliette room, clearing the
          doorframe fast, eyes wider than they had ever been. Only <br/>place to hide was behind the well, she sliding
          sideways around the wall, both hands on <br/>the gun, arms out straight, a little pressure on the trigger, on
          around the well and nobody </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>behind it. <br/>A small scream rising from the well like thin smoke. Yipping now, a dog. She <br/></p>
        <p>approached the Well, eyes on the door, got to the rim, looked over the edge. Saw the girl, <br/>looked up
          again, down again, said what she was trained to say, calm the hostage: <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;FBI, you're safe.&quot; <br/>&quot;Safe SHIT, he's got a gun. Getmeout. GETMEOUT.&quot; <br/>&quot;Catherine,
          you'll be all right. Shut up. Do you know where he is?&quot; <br/>&quot;GETMEOUT, I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHERE HE
          IS, GETMEOUT.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'll get you out. Be quiet. Help me. Be quiet so I can hear. Try and shut that
          dog <br/></p>
        <p>up.&quot; <br/>Braced behind the well, covering the door, her heart pounded and her breath blew <br/></p>
        <p>dust off the stone. She could not leave Catherine Martin to get help when she didn't know <br/>where Gumb
          was. She moved up to the door and took cover behind the frame. She could <br/>see across the foot of the
          stairs and into part of the workroom beyond. <br/></p>
        <p>Either she found Gumb, or she made sure he'd fled, or she took Catherine out with <br/>her, those were the
          only choices. <br/></p>
        <p>A quick look over her shoulder, around the oubliette room. <br/>&quot;Catherine. Catherine. Is there a
          ladder?&quot; <br/>&quot;I don't know, I woke up down here. He let the bucket down on strings.&quot; <br/>Bolted
          to a wall beam was a small hand winch. There was no line on the drum of <br/></p>
        <p>the winch. <br/>&quot;Catherine, I have to find something to get you out with. Can you walk?&quot; <br/>&quot;Yes.
          Don't leave me.&quot; <br/>&quot;I have to leave the room for just a minute.&quot; <br/>&quot;You fucking
          bitch don't you leave me down here, my mother will tear your <br/></p>
        <p>goddamn shit brains out---&quot; <br/>&quot;Catherine shut up. I want you to be quiet so I can hear. To <i>save </i>yourself
          be quiet, <br/></p>
        <p>do you understand?&quot; Then, louder, &quot;The other officers will be here any minute, now shut <br/>up. We
          won't leave you down there.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>He had to have a rope. Where was it? Go see. <br/>Starling moved across the stairwell in one rush, to the
          door of the workroom, <br/></p>
        <p>door's the worst place, in fast, back and forth along the near wall until she had seen all the <br/>room,
          familiar shapes swimming in the glass tanks, she too alert to be startled. Quickly <br/>through the room, past
          the tanks, the sinks, past the cage, a few big moths flying. She <br/>ignored them. <br/></p>
        <p>Approaching the corridor beyond, it blazing with light. The refrigerator turned on <br/>behind her. and she
          spun in a crouch, hammer lifting off the frame of the Magnum, eased <br/>the pressure off. On to the corridor.
          She wasn't taught to peek. Head and gun at once, but <br/>low. The corridor empty. The studio blazing with
          light at the end of it. Fast along it, <br/>gambling past the closed door, on to the studio door. The room all
          white and blond oak. <br/>Hell to clear from the doorway. Make sure every mannequin is a mannequin, every
          <br/>reflection is a mannequin. Only movement in the mirrors <i>your </i>movement. <br/></p>
        <p>The great armoire stood open and empty. The far door open onto darkness, the <br/>basement beyond. No rope,
          no ladder anywhere. No lights beyond the studio. She closed <br/>the door into the dark part of the basement,
          pushed a chair under the knob, and pushed a <br/>sewing machine against it. If she could be positive he wasn't
          in this part of the basement, </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>she'd risk going upstairs for a moment to find a phone. <br/>Back down the corridor, one door she'd
        passed. Get on the side opposite the <br/></p>
        <p>hinges. All the way open in one move. The door slammed back, nobody behind it. An old <br/>bathroom. In it,
          rope, hooks, a sling. Get Catherine or go for the phone? In the bottom of <br/>the well Catherine wouldn't get
          shot by accident. But if Starling got killed. Catherine was <br/>dead too. Take Catherine with her to the
          phone. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling didn't want to stay in the bathroom long. He could come to the door and <br/>hose her. She looked
          both ways and ducked inside for the rope. There was a big bathtub <br/>in the room. The tub was almost filled
          with hard red-purple plaster. A hand and wrist <br/>stuck up from the plaster, the hand turned dark and
          shriveled, the fingernails painted <br/>pink. On the wrist was a dainty watch. Starling was seeing everything
          at once, the rope, <br/>the tub, the hand, the watch. <br/></p>
        <p>The tiny insect-crawl of the second-hand was the last thing she saw before the <br/>lights went out. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Her heart knocked hard enough to shake her chest and arms. Dizzy dark, need to <br/>touch something, the edge
          of the tub. The bathroom. Get out of the bathroom. If he can <br/>find the door he can hose this room, nothing
          to get behind. Oh dear Jesus go out. Go out <br/>down low and out in the hall. Every light out? Every light.
          He must have done it at the <br/>fuse box, pulled the lever, where would it be? Where would the fuse box be?
          Near the <br/>stairs. Lot of times near the stairs. If it is, he&quot;ll come from that way. But he's between
          me <br/>and Catherine. <br/></p>
        <p>Catherine Martin was keening again. <br/>Wait here? Wait forever? Maybe he's gone. He can't be sure no
          backup's coming. <br/></p>
        <p>Yes he can. But soon I'll be missed. Tonight. The stairs are in the direction of the <br/>screams. Solve it
          now. <br/></p>
        <p>She moved, quietly, her shoulder barely brushing the wall, brushing it too lightly <br/>for sound, one hand
          extended ahead, the gun at waist level, close to her in the confined <br/>hallway. Out into the workroom now.
          Feel the space opening up. Open room. In the <br/>crouch in the open room, arms out, both hands on the gun.
          You know exactly where the <br/>gun is, it's just below eye level. Stop, listen. Head and body and arms
          turning together <br/>like a turret. Stop, listen. <br/></p>
        <p>In absolute black the hiss of steam pipes, trickle of water. <br/>Heavy in her nostrils the smell of the
          goat. <br/>Catherine keening. <br/>Against the wall stood Mr. Gumb with his goggles on. There was no danger
          she'd <br/></p>
        <p>bump into him--- there was an equipment table between them. He played his infrared <br/>light up and down
          her. She was too slender to be of great utility to him. He remembered <br/>her hair though, from the kitchen,
          and it was glorious, and that would only take a minute. <br/>He could slip it right off. Put it on, himself.
          He could lean over the well wearing it and <br/>tell that thing &quot;Surprise!&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>It was fun to watch her trying to sneak along. She had her hip against the sinks <br/>now, creeping toward
          the screams with her gun stuck out. It would have been fun to hunt <br/>her for a long time--- he'd never
          hunted one armed before. He would have <i>thoroughly <br/></i>enjoyed it. No time for that. Pity. <br/></p>
        <p>A shot in the face would be fine and easy at eight feet. Now. <br/>He cocked the Python as he brought it up
          snick snick and the figure blurred, </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>bloomed bloomed green in his vision and his gun bucked in his hand and the floor hit him <br/>hard in the
        back and his light was on and he saw the ceiling. Starling on the floor, flash-<br/>blind, ears ringing,
        deafened by the blast of the guns. She worked in the dark while <br/>neither could hear, dump the empties, tip
        it, feel to see they're all out, in with the <br/>speedloader, feel it, tip it down, twist, drop it, close the
        cylinder. She'd fired four. Two <br/>shots and two shots. He'd fired once. She found the two good cartridges
        she'd dumped. <br/>Put them where? In the speedloader pouch. She lay still. Move before he can hear? <br/></p>
        <p>The sound of a revolver being cocked is like no other. She'd fired at the sound, <br/>seen nothing past the
          great muzzle flashes of the guns. She hoped he'd fire now in the <br/>wrong direction, give her the muzzle
          flash to shoot at. Her hearing was coming back, her <br/>ears still rang, but she could hear. <br/></p>
        <p>What was that sound? Whistling? Like a teakettle, but interrupted. What was it? <br/>Like breathing. Is it
          me? No. Her breath blew warm off the floor, back in her face. <br/>Careful, don't get dust, don't sneeze. It's
          breathing. It's a sucking chest wound. He's hit in <br/>the chest. They'd taught her how to seal one, to put
          something over it, a rain slicker, a <br/>plastic bag, something airtight, strap it tight. Reinflate the lung.
          She'd hit him in the chest, <br/>then. What to do? Wait. Let him stiffen up and bleed. Wait. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling's cheek stung. She didn't touch it, if it was bleeding she didn't want her <br/>hands slick. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>The moaning from the well came again, Catherine talking, crying. Starling had to <br/>wait. She couldn't
          answer Catherine. She couldn't say anything or move. <br/></p>
        <p>Mr. Gumb's invisible light played on the ceiling. He tried to move it and he <br/>couldn't, any more than he
          could move his head. A great Malaysian Luna Moth passing <br/>close beneath the ceiling picked up the infrared
          and came down, circled, lit on the light. <br/>The pulsing shadows of its wings, enormous on the ceiling, were
          visible only to Mr. <br/>Gumb. <br/></p>
        <p>Over the sucking in the dark, Starling heard Mr. Gumb's ghastly voice, choking: <br/>&quot;How... does... it
          feel... to be... so beautiful?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>And then another sound. A gurgle, a rattle and the whistling stopped. <br/>Starling knew that sound too.
          She'd heard it once before, at the hospital when her <br/></p>
        <p>father died. <br/>She felt for the edge of the table and got to her feet. Feeling her way along, going <br/>
        </p>
        <p>toward the sounds of Catherine, she found the stairwell and climbed the stairs in the dark. <br/>It seemed to
          take a long time. There was a candle in the kitchen drawer. With it <br/></p>
        <p>she found the fuse box beside the stairs, jumped when the lights came on. To get to the <br/>fuse box and
          shut off the lights, he must have left the basement another way and come <br/>down again behind her. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling had to be positive he was dead. She waited until her eyes were well <br/>adjusted to the light
          before she went aback in the workroom, and then she was careful. <br/>She could see his naked feet and legs
          sticking out from under the workable. She kept her <br/>eyes on the hand beside the gun until she kicked the
          gun away. His eyes were open. He <br/>was dead, shot through the right side of the chest, thick blood under
          him. He had put on <br/>some of his things from the armoire and she couldn't look at him long. <br/></p>
        <p>She went to the sink, put the Magnum on the drainboard and ran cold water on her <br/>wrists, wiped her face
          with her wet hand. No blood. Moths batted at the mesh around the <br/>lights. She had to step around the body
          to retrieve the Python. </p>

        <p><br/>The local television crews arrived just after the fire department and before the <br/></p>
        <p>Belvedere police. The fire captain, angered at the glare from the lights, drove the <br/>television crews
          back up the stairs and out of the basement while he rigged a pipe frame <br/>to hoist out Catherine Martin,
          not trusting Mr. Gumb's hook in the ceiling joist. A <br/>fireman went down into the well and put her in the
          rescue chair. Catherine came out <br/>holding the dog, kept the dog in the ambulance. <br/></p>
        <p>They drew the line on dogs at the hospital and wouldn't let the dog in. A fireman, <br/>instructed to drop it
          off at the animal shelter, took it home with him instead. <br/></p>

        <p>eye flight from Columbus, Ohio. Most of them were meeting relatives and they looked <br/>sleepy and grumpy
          enough, with their shirttails sticking out below their jackets. <br/></p>
        <p>From the crowd, Ardelia Mapp had a chance to look Starling over as she came off <br/>the plane. Starling was
          pasty, dark under the eyes. Some black grains of gunpowder were <br/>in her cheek. Starling spotted Mapp and
          they hugged. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Hey, Sport,&quot; Mapp said. &quot;You check anything?&quot; <br/>Starling shook her head. <br/>&quot;Jeff's
          outside in the van. Let's go home.&quot; <br/>Jack Crawford was outside too, his car parked behind the van in
          the limousine <br/></p>
        <p>lane. He'd had Bella's relatives all night. <br/>&quot;I...&quot; he started. &quot;You know what you did.
          You hit a home run, kid.&quot; He touched <br/></p>
        <p>her cheek. &quot;What's this?&quot; <br/>&quot;Burnt gunpowder. The doctor said it'll work out by itself in a
          couple of days--- <br/></p>
        <p>better than digging for it.&quot; <br/>Crawford took her to him and held her very tight for a moment, just a
          moment, <br/></p>
        <p>and then put her away from him and kissed her on the forehead. &quot;You know what you <br/>did,&quot; he
          said again. &quot;Go home. Go to sleep. Sleep in. I'll talk to you tomorrow.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The new surveillance van was comfortable, designed for long stakeouts. Starling <br/>and Mapp rode in the big
          chairs in the back. <br/></p>
        <p>Without Jack Crawford in the van, Jeff drove a little harder. They made good time <br/>toward Quantico. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Starling rode with her eyes closed. After a couple of miles, Mapp nudged her <br/>knee. Mapp had opened two
          short-bottle Cokes. She handed Starling a Coke and took a </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>half-pint of Jack Daniel's out of her purse. <br/>They each took a swig out of their Cokes and poured in a
        shot of sour mash. Then <br/></p>
        <p>they stuck their thumbs in the necks of the bottles, shook them, and shot the foam in their <br/>mouths.
          <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Ahhh,&quot; Starling said. <br/>&quot;Don't spill that in here,&quot; Jeff said. <br/>&quot;Don't
          worry, Jeff,&quot; Mapp said. Quietly to Starling, &quot;You should have seen my <br/></p>
        <p>man Jeff waiting for me outside the liquor store. He looked like he was passing peach <br/>seeds.&quot; When
          Mapp saw the whiskey start to work a little, when Starling sank a little <br/>deeper in her chair, Mapp said,
          &quot;How you doing, Starling?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Ardelia, I'm damned if I know.&quot; <br/>&quot;You don't have to go back, do you?&quot; <br/>&quot;Maybe
          for one day next week, but I hope not. The U.S. Attorney came over from <br/></p>
        <p>Columbus to talk to the Belvedere cops. I did depositions out the wazoo,&quot; <br/>&quot;Couple of good
          things,&quot; Mapp said. &quot;Senator Martin's been on the phone all <br/></p>
        <p>evening from Bethesda--- you knew they took Catherine to Bethesda? Well, she's okay. <br/>He didn't mess her
          up in any physical way. Emotional damage, they don't know, they <br/>have to watch. Don't worry about school.
          Crawford and Brigham both called. The <br/>hearing's canceled. Krendler asked for his memo back. These people
          have got a heart like <br/>a greasy BB, Starling--- you get no slack. You don't have to take the
          Search-and-Seizure <br/>exam at 0800 tomorrow, but you take it Monday, and the PE test right after. We'll jam
          <br/>over the weekend.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>They finished the half-pint just north of Quantico and dumped the evidence in a <br/>barrel at a roadside
          park. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That Pilcher, Doctor Pilcher at the Smithsonian, called three times. Made me <br/>promise to tell you
          he called.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He's not a doctor.&quot; <br/>&quot;You think you might do something about him?&quot; <br/>&quot;Maybe.
          I don't know yet.&quot; <br/>&quot;He sounds like he's pretty funny. I've about decided funny's the best thing
          in <br/></p>
        <p>men, I'm talking about <i>aside </i>from money and your basic manageability.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yeah, and
          manners too, you can't leave that out.&quot; <br/>&quot;Right. Give me a son of a bitch with some manners
          every time.&quot; <br/>Starling went like a zombie from the shower to the bed. <br/>Mapp kept her reading
          light on for a while, until Starling's breathing was regular. <br/></p>
        <p>Starling jerked in her sleep, a muscle in her cheek twitched, and once her eyes opened <br/>wide. <br/></p>
        <p>Mapp woke sometime before daylight, the room feeling empty. Mapp turned on <br/>her light. Starling was not
          in her bed. Both of their laundry bags were missing, so Mapp <br/>knew where to look. <br/></p>
        <p>She found Starling in the warm laundry room, dozing against the slow rump-rump <br/>of a washing machine in
          the smell of bleach and soap and fabric softener. Starling had the <br/>psychology background--- Mapp's was
          law--- yet it was Mapp who knew that the <br/>washing machine's rhythm was like a great heartbeat and the rush
          of its waters was what <br/>the unborn hear--- our last memory of peace. <br/></p>

    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p><b> <br/>CHAPTER 58 <br/> <br/>J</b>ack Crawford woke early on the sofa in his study and heard the snoring
        of his in-<br/></p>
        <p>laws in his house. In the free moment before the weight of the day came on him, he <br/>remembered not
          Bella's death, but the last thing she'd said to him, her eyes clear and <br/>calm: &quot;What's going on in
          the yard?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>He took Bella's grain scoop and, in his bathrobe, went out and fed the birds as he <br/>had promised to do.
          Leaving a note for his sleeping in-laws, he eased out of the house <br/>before sunrise. Crawford had always
          gotten along with Bella's relatives, more or less, and <br/>it helped to have the noise in the house, but he
          was glad to get away to Quantico. <br/></p>
        <p>He was going through the overnight telex traffic and watching the early news in <br/>his office when Starling
          pressed her nose to the glass of the door. He dumped some <br/>reports out of a chair for her and they watched
          the news together without saying anything. <br/>Here it came. <br/></p>
        <p>The outside of Jame Gumb's old building in Belvedere with its empty storefront <br/>and soaped windows
          covered with heavy gates. Starling hardly recognized it. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Dungeon of Horrors,&quot; the news leader called it. <br/>Harsh, jostled pictures of the well and the
          basement, still cameras held up before <br/></p>
        <p>the television camera, and angry firemen waving the photographers back. Moths crazed <br/>by the television
          lights, flying into the lights, a moth on the floor on its back, wings <br/>beating down to a final tremor.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Catherine Martin refusing a stretcher and walking to the ambulance with a <br/>policeman's coat around her,
          the dog sticking its face out between the lapels. <br/></p>
        <p>A side view of Starling walking fast to a car, her head down, hands in the pockets <br/>of her coat. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>The film was edited to exclude some of the more grisly objects. In the far reaches <br/>of the basement, the
          cameras could show only the low, lime-sprinkled thresholds of the <br/>chambers holding Gumb's tableaux. The
          body count in that part of the basement stood at <br/>six so far. <br/></p>
        <p>Twice Crawford heard Starling expel air through her nose. The news went to a <br/>commercial break. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Good morning, Starling.&quot; <br/>&quot;Hello,&quot; she said, as though it were later in the day.
          <br/>&quot;The U.S. Attorney in Columbus faxed me your depositions overnight. You'll <br/></p>
        <p>have to sign some copies for him... So you went from Fredrica Bimmel's house to Stacy <br/>Hubka, and then to
          the Burdine woman at the store Bimmel sewed for, Richards' <br/>Fashions, and Mrs. Burdine gave you Mrs.
          Lippman's old address, the building there.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>Stalling nodded. &quot;Stacy Hubka had been by the place a couple of times to pick up <br/>Fredrica, but
          Stacy's boyfriend was driving and her directions were vague. Mrs. Burdine <br/>had the address.&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Mrs. Burdine never mentioned a man at Mrs. Lippman's?&quot; <br/>&quot;No.&quot; <br/>The television
          news had film from Bethesda Naval Hospital. Senator Ruth <br/></p>
        <p>Martin's face framed in a limousine window. <br/>&quot;Catherine was rational last night, yes. She's
          sleeping, she's sedated right now. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>We're counting our blessings. No, as I said before, she's suffering from shock, but she's <br/>rational.
        Just bruises, and her finger is broken. And she's dehydrated as well. Thank you.&quot; <br/>She poked her
        chauffeur in the back. &quot;Thank you. No, she mentioned the dog to me last <br/>night, I don't know what we'll
        do about it, we already <i>have </i>two dogs.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>The story closed with a nothing quote from a stress specialist who would be <br/>talking with Catherine
          Martin later in the day to assess emotional damage. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford shut it off. <br/>&quot;How're you hittin 'em, Starling?&quot; <br/>&quot;Kind of numb... you too?&quot;
          <br/>Crawford nodded, quickly moved along. &quot;Senator Martin's been on the phone <br/></p>
        <p>overnight. She wants to come see you. Catherine does too, as soon as she can travel.&quot; <br/>&quot;I'm
          always home.&quot; <br/>&quot;Krendler too, he wants to come down here. He asked for his memo back.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Come to think of it, I'm not always home.&quot; <br/>&quot;Here's some free advice. Use Senator
          Martin. Let her tell you how grateful she is, <br/></p>
        <p>let her hand you the markers. Do it soon. Gratitude has a short half-life. You'll need her <br/>one of these
          days, the way you act.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;That's what Ardelia says.&quot; <br/>&quot;Your roomie, Mapp? The Superintendent told me Mapp's set to
          cram you for <br/></p>
        <p>your makeup exams on Monday. She just pulled a point and a half ahead of her archrival, <br/>'Stringfellow,
          he tells me.&quot;' <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;For valedictorian?&quot; <br/>&quot;He's tough, though, Stringfellow--- he's saying she can't hold him
          off.&quot; <br/>&quot;He best bring his lunch.&quot; <br/>In the clutter on Crawford's desk was the origami
          chicken Dr. Lecter had folded. <br/></p>
        <p>Crawford worked the tail up and down. The chicken pecked. <br/>&quot;Lecter's gone platinum--- he's at the
          top of everybody's Most Wanted list,&quot; he <br/></p>
        <p>said. &quot;Still, he could be out for a while. Off the post, you need some good habits.&quot; <br/>She
          nodded. <br/>&quot;He's busy now,&quot; Crawford said, &quot;but when he's not busy, he'll entertain himself.
          <br/></p>
        <p>We need to be clear on this: You know he'd do it to you, just like he'd do anybody else.&quot; <br/>&quot;I
          don't think he'd ever bushwhack me--- it's rude, and he wouldn't get to ask any <br/></p>
        <p>questions that way. Sure he'd do it as soon as I bored him.&quot; <br/>&quot;Maintain good habits is all I'm
          saying. When you go off the post, flag your three-<br/></p>
        <p>card--- no phone queries on your whereabouts without positive ID. I want to put a trace-<br/>alert on your
          telephone, if you don't mind. It'll be private unless you push the button.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;I don't look for him to come after me, Mr. Crawford.&quot; <br/>&quot;But you heard what I said.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;I did. I did hear.&quot; <br/>&quot;Take these depositions and look 'em over. Add if you want to.
          We'll witness <br/></p>
        <p>your' signatures here when you're ready. Starling, I'm proud of you. So is Brigham, so is <br/>the Director.&quot;
          It sounded stiff, not like he wanted it to sound. <br/></p>
        <p>He went to his office door. She was going away from him, down the deserted hall. <br/>He managed to hail her
          from his berg of grief: &quot;Starling, your father sees you.&quot; <br/></p>

    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p><b>CHAPTER 59 <br/> <br/>J</b>ame Gumb was news for weeks after he was lowered into his final hole. <br/>Reporters
        pieced together his history, beginning with the records of Sacramento <br/></p>
        <p>County: <br/>His mother had been carrying him a month when she failed to place in the Miss <br/></p>
        <p>Sacramento Contest in 1948. The &quot;Jame&quot; on his birth certificate apparently was a clerical <br/>error
          that no one bothered to correct. <br/></p>
        <p>When her acting career failed to materialize, his mother went into an alcoholic <br/>decline; Gumb was two
          when Los Angeles County placed him in a foster home. <br/></p>
        <p>At least two scholarly journals explained that this unhappy childhood was the <br/>reason he killed women in
          his basement for their skins. The words <i>crazy </i>and <i>evil </i>do not <br/>appear in either article.
          <br/></p>
        <p>The film of the beauty contest that Jame Gumb watched as an adult was real <br/>footage of his mother, but
          the woman in the swimming pool film was not his mother, <br/>comparative measurements revealed. <br/></p>
        <p>Gumb's grandparents retrieved him from an unsatisfactory foster home when he <br/>was ten, and he killed them
          two years later. <br/></p>
        <p>Tulare Vocational Rehabilitation taught Gumb to be a tailor during his years at <br/>the psychiatric
          hospital. He demonstrated definite aptitude for the work. <br/></p>
        <p>Gumb's employment record is broken and incomplete. Reporters found at least <br/>two restaurants where he
          worked off the books, and he worked sporadically in the <br/>clothing business. It has not been proven that he
          killed during this period, but Benjamin <br/>Raspail said he did. <br/></p>
        <p>He was working at the curio store where the butterfly ornaments were made when <br/>he met Raspail, and he
          lived off the musician for some time. It was then that Gumb <br/>became obsessed with moths and butterflies
          and the changes they go through. <br/></p>
        <p>After Raspail left him, Gumb killed Raspail's next lover, Klaus, beheaded and <br/>partially flayed him.
          <br/></p>
        <p>Later he dropped in on Raspail in the East. Raspail, ever thrilled by bad boys, <br/>introduced him to Dr.
          Lecter. <br/></p>
        <p>This was proven in the week after Gumb's death when the FBI seized from <br/>Raspail's next of kin the tapes
          of Raspail's therapy sessions with Dr. Lecter. <br/></p>
        <p>Years ago, when Dr. Lecter was declared insane, the therapy-session tapes had <br/>been turned over to the
          families of the victims to be destroyed. But Raspail's wrangling <br/>relatives kept the tapes, hoping to use
          them to attack Raspail's will. They had lost interest <br/>listening to the early tapes, which are only
          Raspail's boring reminiscences of school life. <br/>After the news coverage of Jame Gumb, the Raspail family
          listened to the rest. When the <br/>relatives called the lawyer Everett Yow and threatened to use the tapes in
          a renewed <br/>assault on Raspail's will, Yow called Clarice Starling. <br/></p>
        <p>The tapes include the final session, when Lecter killed Raspail. More important, <br/>they reveal how much
          Raspail told Lecter about Jame Gumb: <br/></p>
        <p>Raspail told Dr. Lecter that Gumb was obsessed with moths, that he had flayed <br/>people in the past, that
          he had killed Klaus, that he had a job with the Mr. Hide leather-<br/>goods company in Calumet City, but was
          taking money from an old lady in Belvedere, <br/>Ohio, who had made linings for Mr. Hide, Inc. One day Gumb
          would take everything the </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>old lady had, Raspail predicted. <br/>&quot;When Lecter read that the first victim was from Belvedere and
        she was flayed, <br/></p>
        <p>he knew who was doing it,&quot; Crawford told Starling as they listened together to the tape. <br/>&quot;He'd
          have given you Gumb and looked like a genius if Chilton had stayed out of it.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He hinted to me by writing in the file that the sites were too random,&quot; Starling <br/>said. &quot;And
          in Memphis he asked me if I sew. What did he want to happen?&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He wanted to amuse himself,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;He's been amusing himself for a <br/>long, long
          time.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>No tape of Jame Gumb was ever found, and his activities in the years after <br/>Raspail's death were
          established piecemeal through business correspondence, gas re-<br/>ceipts, interviews with boutique owners.
          <br/></p>
        <p>When Mrs. Lippman died on a trip to Florida with Gumb, he inherited everything-<br/>-- the old building with
          its living quarters and empty storefront and vast basement, and a <br/>comfortable amount of money. He stopped
          working for Mr. Hide, but maintained an <br/>apartment in Calumet City for a while, and used the business
          address to receive packages <br/>in the John Grant name. He kept favored customers, and continued to travel to
          boutiques <br/>around the country, as he had for Mr. Hide, measuring for custom garments he made in <br/>Belvedere.
          He used his trips to scout for victims and to dump them when they were used <br/>up--- the brown van droning
          for hours on the Interstate with finished leather garments <br/>swaying on racks in the back above the
          rubberized body bag on the floor. <br/></p>
        <p>He had the wonderful freedom of the basement. Room to work and play. At first it <br/>was only games---
          hunting young women through the black warren, creating amusing <br/>tableaux in remote rooms and sealing them
          up, opening the doors again only to throw in a <br/>little lime. <br/></p>
        <p>Fredrica Bimmel began to help Mrs. Lippman in the last year of the old lady's life. <br/>Fredrica was picking
          up sewing at Mrs. Lippman's when she met Jame Gumb. Fredrica <br/>Bimmel was not the first young woman he
          killed, but she was the first one he killed for <br/>her skin. <br/></p>
        <p>Fredrica Bimmel's letters to Gumb were found among his things. <br/>Starling could hardly read the letters,
          because of the hope in them, because of the <br/></p>
        <p>dreadful need in them, because of the endearments from Gumb that were implied in her <br/>responses: &quot;Dearest
          Secret Friend in my Breast, I love you!--- I didn't <i>ever </i>think I'd get to <br/>say that, and it is best
          of all to get to say it <i>back</i>.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>When did he reveal himself? Had she discovered the basement? How did her face <br/>look when he changed, how
          long did he keep her alive? <br/></p>
        <p>Worst, Fredrica and Gumb truly were friends to the last; she wrote him a note <br/>from the pit. <br/></p>
        <p>The tabloids changed Gumb's nickname to Mr. Hide and, sick because they hadn't <br/>thought of the name
          themselves, virtually started over with the story. <br/></p>
        <p>Safe in the heart of Quantico, Starling did not have to deal with the press, but the <br/>tabloid press dealt
          with her. <br/></p>
        <p>From Dr. Frederick Chilton, the<i> National Tattler </i>bought the tapes of Starling's <br/>interview with
          Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The <i>Tattler </i>expanded on their conversations for their <br/>&quot;Bride of Dracula&quot;
          series and implied that Starling had made frank sexual revelations to <br/>Lecter in exchange for information,
          spurring an offer to Starling from <i>Velvet Talks: The <br/>Journal of Telephone Sex. </i></p>

        <p>Starling cut out the picture of Hannah and put it in her wallet. It was the only <br/>thing she saved. <br/>

        <p>She had fallen behind Starling on the jogging trail and caught up at the old DC-6 <br/>the FBI uses for
          hijack simulations. It was Sunday morning. They had been on the books <br/>for two days, and the pale sun felt
          good. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;So what did Pilcher say on the phone?&quot; Mapp said, leaning against the landing <br/>gear. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;He and his sister have this place on the Chesapeake.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yeah, and?&quot; <br/>&quot;His
          sister's there with her kids and dogs and maybe her husband.&quot; <br/>&quot;So?&quot; <br/>&quot;They're in
          one end of the house--- it's a big old dump on the water they inherited <br/></p>
        <p>from his grandmother.&quot; <br/>&quot;Cut to the chase.&quot; <br/>&quot;Pilch has the other end of the
          house. Next weekend, he wants us to go. Lots of <br/></p>
        <p>rooms, he says. 'As many rooms as anybody might need,' I believe is the way he put it. <br/>His sister would
          call and invite me, he said.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;No kidding. I didn't know people did that anymore.&quot; <br/>&quot;He did this nice scenario--- no
          hassles, bundle up and walk on the beach, come in <br/></p>
        <p>and there's a fire going, dogs jump all over you with their big sandy paws.&quot; <br/>&quot;Idyllic,
          umm-humm, big sandy paws, go on.&quot; <br/>&quot;It's kind of much, considering we've never had a date, even.
          He claims it's best to <br/></p>
        <p>sleep with two or three big dogs when it gets really cold. He says they've got, enough <br/>dogs for
          everybody to have a couple.&quot; <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Pilcher's setting you up for the old dog-suit trick, you snapped to that didn't <br/>you?&quot; <br/>
        </p>
        <p>&quot;He claims to be a good cook. His sister say he is.&quot; <br/>&quot;Oh, she called already.&quot; <br/>&quot;Yep.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;How'd she sound?&quot; <br/>&quot;Okay. Sounded like she was in the other end of the house.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;What did you tell her?&quot; <br/>&quot;I said, 'Yes, thank you very much,' is what I said.&quot;
          <br/>&quot;Good,&quot; Mapp said. &quot;That's very good. Eat some crabs. Grab Pilcher, and smooch <br/></p>
        <p>him on his face, go wild.&quot; </p>

      <div><p><br/><b> <br/>CHAPTER 61 <br/> <br/>D</b>own the deep carpet in the corridor of the Marcus Hotel, a
        room-service waiter <br/></p>
        <p>trundled a cart. <br/>At the door of suite 91, he stopped and rapped softly on the door with his gloved <br/>
        </p>
        <p>knuckle. He cocked his head and rapped again to be heard above the music from within--- <br/><i>Bach, Two-
          and Three-Part Inventions,</i> Glenn Gould at the piano. <br/></p>
        <p>&quot;Come.&quot; <br/>The gentleman with the bandage across his nose was in a dressing gown, writing <br/>
        </p>
        <p>at the desk. <br/>&quot;Put it by the windows. May I see the wine?&quot; <br/>The waiter brought it. The
          gentleman held it under the light of his desk lamp, <br/></p>
        <p>touched the neck to his cheek. <br/>&quot;Open it, but leave it off the ice,&quot; he said, and wrote a
          generous tip across the <br/></p>
        <p>bottom of the bill. &quot;I won't taste it now.&quot; <br/>He did not want the waiter handing him wine to
          taste--- he found the smell of the <br/></p>
        <p>man's watchband objectionable. <br/>Dr. Lecter was in an excellent humor. His week had gone well. His
          appearance <br/></p>
        <p>was coming right along, and as soon as a few small discolorations cleared, he could take <br/>off his
          bandages and pose for passport photos. <br/></p>
        <p>The actual work he was doing himself--- minor injections of silicone in his nose. <br/>The silicone gel was
          not a prescription item, but the hypodermics and the Novocaine <br/>were. He got around this difficulty by
          pinching a prescription off the counter of a busy <br/>pharmacy near the hospital. He blanked out the chicken
          scratches of the legitimate <br/>physician with typist's correction fluid and photocopied the blank
          prescription form. The <br/>first prescription he wrote was a copy of the one he stole, and he returned it to
          the <br/>pharmacy, so nothing was missing. <br/></p>
        <p>The palooka effect in his fine features was not pleasing, and he knew the silicone <br/>would move araund if
          he wasn't careful, but the job would do until he got to Rio. <br/></p>
        <p>When his hobbies began to absorb Him--- long before his first arrest--- Dr. Letter <br/>had made provisions
          for a time when he might be a fugitive. In the wall of a vacation <br/>cottage on the banks of the Susquehanna
          River were money and the credentials of another <br/>identity, including a passport and the cosmetic aids he'd
          worn in the passport photos. The <br/>passport would have expired by now, but it could be renewed very
          quickly. <br/></p>
        <p>Preferring to be herded through customs with a big tour badge on his chest, he'd <br/>already signed up for a
          ghastly sounding tour called &quot;South American Splendor&quot; that <br/>would take him as far as Rio. <br/>
        </p>
        <p>He reminded himself to write a check on the late Lloyd Wyman for the hotel bill <br/>and get the extra five
          days' lead while the check plodded through the bank, rather than <br/>sending an Amex charge into the
          computer. <br/></p>
        <p>This evening he was catching up on his correspondence, which he would have to <br/>send through a remailing
          service in London. <br/></p>
        <p>First, he sent to Barney a generous tip and a thank-you note for his many <br/>courtesies at the asylum. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always">
      <div><p>Next, he dropped a note to Dr. Frederick Chilton in federal protective custody, <br/>suggesting that he
        would be paying Dr. Chilton a visit in the near future. After this visit, <br/>he wrote, it would make sense for
        the hospital to tattoo feeding instructions on Chilton's <br/>forehead to save paperwork. <br/></p>
        <p>Last, he poured himself a glass of the excellent Batard-Montrachet and addressed <br/>Clarice Starling: <br/>
        </p>
        <p><br/>Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming? <br/>You owe me a piece of information, you know, and
          that's what I'd like. <br/>An ad in the national edition of the <i>Times </i>and in the <i>International
            Herald-Tribune <br/></i></p>
        <p>on the first of any month will be fine. Better put it in the <i>China Mail </i>as well. <br/>I won't be
          surprised if the answer is yes and no. The lambs will stop for now. But, <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice, you judge yourself with all the mercy of the dungeon scales at Threave; you'll <br/>have to earn it
          again and again, the blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, <br/>seeing the plight, and the
          plight will not end, ever. <br/></p>
        <p>I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you <br/>in it. Be sure you
          extend me the same courtesy. <br/></p>
        <p><br/>Dr. Lecter touched his pen to his lips. He looked out at the night sky and smiled. <br/> <br/>I have
          windows. <br/>Orion is above the horizon now, and near it Jupiter, brighter than it will ever be <br/></p>
        <p>again before the year 2000. (I have no intention of telling you the time and how high it <br/>is.) But I
          expect you can see it too. Some of our stars are the same. Clarice. <br/></p>
        <p><br/>Hannibal Lecter <br/> <br/>Far to the east, on the Chesapeake shore, Orion stood high in the clear
          night, <br/></p>
        <p>above a big old house, and a room where a fire is banked for the night, its light pulsing <br/>gently with
          the wind above the chimneys. On a large bed there are many quilts and on the <br/>quilts and under them are
          several large dogs. Additional mounds beneath the covers may <br/>or may not be Noble Pilcher,<b> </b>it is
          impossible to determine in the ambient light. But the <br/>face on the pillow, rosy in the firelight, is
          certainly that of Clarice Starling, and she sleeps <br/>deeply, sweetly, in the silence of the lambs. <br/>
        </p>
        <p><br/> <br/></p>
        <p>---------- <br/> <br/> <br/></p>
        <p>In his note of condolence to Jack Crawford, Dr. Lecter quotes from &quot;A Fever&quot; <br/>without troubling
          to credit John Donne. <br/></p>
        <p>Clarice Starling's memory alters lines from T. S. Eliot's &quot;Ash-Wednesday&quot; to suit <br/>her. <br/>
